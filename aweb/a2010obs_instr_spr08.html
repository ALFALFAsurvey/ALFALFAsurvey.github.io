Find the 2007 version <a href="a2010obs_instr_2007.html"> here</a>.
Starting in Jan 2008, we are upgrading to CIMA Version 2.3/3.0 which has
many new features, the most important of which are:
<ul><li> You need to start CIMA by typing <b>"cima --X"</b>
<li> Instead of a "saved-state" (.gui), we now use a "configuration file" (.conf) which sets
up all the observing configuration parameters, not just the IF/LO. Therefore <b> there are
fewer steps involved in setting up than before</b>.
     <li> <b>"Help"</b> info is available by right clicking on any widget or parameter
     <li> The sources in your catalog which are "visible" are indicated along with
              their current location, slew time, etc. 
     <li> It is possible to launch the system monitoring widgets from within CIMA.
     <li> <b>"Accept"</b>  is the same as <b>"Apply"+"Dismiss"</b> 
     <li> The <b>scan number convention</b> has changed to ydddNNNNN.fits where
          <b>"y"</b> is the year number, <b>"ddd"</b> is the day number within the
             year and <b>"NNNNN"</b>  is a sequential number which now has nothing to do
             with the time. Note also it has nothing to do with the FITS file number.</b> 
             </ul></p>

<b><font color=#cc0f14>Disclaimer:</font> CIMA changes, conditions change, and we have
to adapt to situations as they develop; this cookbook works today but may not
tomorrow! In particular, as of Jan 11, 2008, we are using the CIMA version
<b>2.3</b>, known as the <b>"Unusable engineering version 2.3.XXX"</b>, soon to be released as <b>3.0</b>. 
Please read the documentation on the <a 
href="http://www2.naic.edu/~cima/">CIMA website</a>. If you want to experiment with
CIMA offline, <font color=darkorange>be careful not to overwrite or change the observing files!</font></b>
<br>

<h2><font color=darkblue>Before Observing</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> The ALFA cover must have been removed. ALFA is covered during radar runs, so take a look 
at the telescope schedule beforehand. For instance, if it looks like ALFA had to be covered 
the day before your observations, make sure that time is allocated to remove the cover before 
your run starts  (this can be done during maintenance or system check time). In any case, it 
is a good idea to double check with the telescope operator.  <b>Know the schedule a few days 
ahead of time; but also ASK!</b>
 
<li>The ALFA motor must be switched on (this should be ok but be aware; if you have any
doubts, ask the operator. It can be done from the control room.). If you have any doubts, 
look for ALFA rotation using the dome video monitors (you should be able to see it move). 
Also, the operator may need to turn on ALFA in software from the control room.

<li> Ask the telescope operator to move to the appropriate azimuth and
approximate zenith angle for the night and, if necessary, to rotate
ALFA into place. <i> Ask him/her to do this <b> before </b> starting
GALSPECT.</i>.
 For the a2010 project, the telescope is fixed at AZ= 360 for Declinations < +16 degrees, and at AZ =180 for
 Declinations > 20 degrees.  The scenario is still be determined for
 other values. (Note that we use azimuth=360 rather than azimuth=0 to
 avoid wrap issues. Note also that Az=180 is equivalent to Az=540:
 choose the value that has the smallest movement from the current position.)<br>
<b> For Jan-March 2008, the azimuth should be set to
180 (or 540)</b> since we are mostly observing <b>north</b> of
zenith, but later, we will require an azimuth
of 360 (NOT 0). Be sure to CHECK THE SCHEDULE.  

 

   <i> Be sure the 
     operator returns telescope control to you. </i>  Note that once you start up CIMA, you'll take over
control of the telescope motion and it will stop. So  wait to start up CIMA. In the meantime, have
the operator start up GALSPECT (see below).

<li> <b>Set up the TOGS starting position.</b> Open up the catalog file <font color=#cc0f14>
/share/obs4/usr/a2010/a2010.cat </font> and  
edit the entry called "galfasrc" to the new right ascension and declination for
that night. As exact start times and slew times 
can change, the observer needs to be ready to adjust the entry by estimating it as the previous
observer is finishing, and again during setup if there are delays, when the telescope will 
be on the meridian.  This needs to be done as quickly as possible. We suggest also that you
take a look at the <a href="docs/instructions_togs.pdf"> TOGS setup
document</a> (provided by the TOGS group) to understand a bit about their setup. 
</p>
</ul>

<h2><font color=darkblue>TOGS GALFA setup - the operator will carry out this step.</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>Login to any machine in the control room to begin the GALFA startup.
<li>Secure shell to the dataview machine:  <b>ssh -l guest dataview</b>
<li>Secure shell to the galfa machine:  <b>ssh -i galfa_key galfa@galfa1</b>
<li>Enter the command:  <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  If you get the message 
<i>LO2:  Set failed, got back:  ERROR setting freq</i>, then you need to start the gpib on the 
wapp server.  To do this, pull up another xterm, and ssh to the wappserver via
<b>ssh
wapp@wappserv</b>.  Ask Brian for the password.  Once logged on, type <b>source 
/share/wappsrc/bin/start_gpib</b>.  Go back to the xterm logged into galfa1 and again type 
<b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  This will run for the rest of the night, so minimize the windows.  

<font color=#cc0f14><i>Note: if the operator is not able to get GALSPECT to run, he/she should call the 
<a href="http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/~mputman/togscontact.html">TOGS contact</a> for
the night.</i></font>
</ul>

<h2><font color=darkblue>Datataking</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> Quickly log into OBSERVER2 as "dtusr" (password taped to the monitor). </p>

<li> When ALFA is in place and you are close to the target position,
     <b> start CIMA </b> either by clicking with the right button of the mouse on the background or
     by <font color=#cc0f14> typing <b>"cima --X"</b> in an available window. 
     </font> <b>(Until further notice (Feb-Mar 2008), use the command line access "cima --X".)</b> When you start
     CIMA, slewing will stop until you issue the observe command, and if you are not close
     to target position, you will have to wait. The <font color=#cc0f14>CIMA version selection window</font> will pop up.
     Select the <b> version we are currently
     using, the "unusable engineering version of CIMA (Ver 2.3.xx") </b> (effective 10Jan2008).
     The <font color=#cc0f14>Start New CIMA </font> window will pop up; read below.

</p>
<li><b><font color=#cc0f14>Start New Cima Session</font></b>
<ul>
  <li> Project number: <b> a2010</b>. This is important. Your settings and log files will be saved 
      (if you decide to do so) in the corresponding project directory, which for us is 
      /share/obs4/usr/a2010/. <i> Be sure to enter small "a"</i>.
  <li> Observer: <b>Your name</b> for entry in operator's logbook.
  <li> Select <b> Line </b>observing mode. 
  <li> Click <b> Accept </b> and CIMA will start up.<br>


Now, several windows will pop up: the
<font color=#cc0f14>CIMA Observation Status</font> window, the <font color=#cc0f14d>CIMA Log Display</font> window, 
the <font color=darkorange>CIMA main menu (observing session)</font>, 
the <font color=#cc0f14>CIMA executive</font> (<font color=#darkred>
red font</font>) and a widget 
entitled <font color=#cc0f14>Receiver selection menu</font>. The <font color=darkorange>CIMA main menu</font>
(which should display the correct version number, now "Version 2.3xx 'unusable'",
is the main window and should always be open. The buttons therein open new windows, which allow you
to control the telescope. These windows will be indicated with <font color=darkorange>orange</font> fonts
in this document; all the other ones will be <font color=#cc0f14>red</font>. (Note: we need to check
this color coding stuff!) </p></ul>

<li><b><font color=#cc0f14>Receiver selection</font><br> </b>
     Select <b>ALFA,</b> <b>Quick Tsys=No, Rotate Receiver=Yes, Retrack=Yes</b> then click on <b>
     Accept.</b> Make sure that ALFA shows up in the AOSTATUS 
     monitor (to your left on top if you are in the control room).  

Keep an eye on the <font color=#cc0f14>CIMA Log Display</font> and don't move to the next step until the
previous has completed; if you click too fast, you run the risk of getting an "executive busy" command.
</p>

<li>Click <b> <font color=darkorange> Utilities</font></b> in the CIMA main menu,
<font color=#cc0f14> <b>Restart the WAPPS.</font> </b>
When the output to log window is complete, close the Utilities window.
</p>
     

<li>If running TOGS, immediately click on <font color=#cc0f14><b>Command File 
Observing</b></font>, and click on the <b>Load</b> button. You may have to click to view
"All Files". Choose the file <b>command_galfasrc</b>.
The file should appear in the right hand box. Be sure that "Run Command File" is set to
<font color=#darkblue>Once</font> and "Start From" is set to <font color=#darkblue>First line</font>.
Click <b>Run</b> to run the file. The <font color=#cc0f14>Observing Menu</font> Window will
open; it will indicate that the Observing Mode is "smart frequency switching". 
The telescope will slew to the position you just set for 'galfasrc' in the 
a2010.cat file, which should be very close to the meridian.  As soon as it gets there it will load the 
togs.gui file, their IFLO setup, and begin 
about 6 minutes of frequency switching calibration.  One only needs to
let it run.  During this time, you can use the waterfall dataview application 
on the dataview machine to see that data are being
taken.  You may also open the log files if you wish.<br>

<font color=#cc0f14><i>Note: if the GALSPECT spectrometer is not set up within ten minutes of their allotted time (so that
the ~6 mins of calibration cannot be run before A2010 is scheduled to start), do not run the TOGS
calibration if the prime A2010 map LST range is reached. However, even if you don't run it at the beginning, 
run the TOGS calibration at the end, if there is time and GALSPECT is running.</i></font>
<br>
As soon as the TOGS calibration is done, <b>Close</b> the "command file" and "observing menu" windows and
proceed with the ALFALFA setup as usual.
</p>
<li>Click on <font color=darkorange>Load configuration </font> in the <font color=darkorange>CIMA
    main menu</font>. 
<ul> <li>Select  <b> a2010_az180.conf</b>. You will see a summary of its "contents" appearing; check that
    everything looks ok to you. This file now sets up just about everything you need.
    It fires the cal at the end of each 
    scan ("loopend-OFF"), and adopts the topocentric reference frame. This will 
    set most of the parameters, but you must still apply the
    configuration in each of the widgets described below. Select the
    appropriate file and click <b> Load and apply</b>. A window warning you to "wait" will pop up 
    while the configuration is taking place. The log display should indicate that things
    are happening and the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu</font> window should pop up
    with the observing mode set to <font color=#darkblue>Fixed azimuth drift map</font>. You should
    also see the basic observing setup indicated: # loops=<b>99</b>, strip time=<b>600</b>secs, 
    Azimuth=<b>180.0</b> (or 360)degs,
    ALFA rot angle=<b>19</b>degs, startposition=<b>(the first source in the file</b>), drift type=<b>Follow Dec J2000</b>,
    Calibration type=<b>Hcorcal</b>, Calibration time=<b>1</b>sec, Calibrate when=<b>On@loopend</b>, Add extra cal=<b>No</b>,
    Adjust power=<b>First loop only</b>, Loops per file=<b>1</b>.</p>
    
   <i>Note: in general, the configuration file depends on
    the azimuth: <b>a2010_az360.conf</b> (Azimuth 360) or <b>a2010_az180.conf</b> (Azimuth 180/540). </i>
</ul></li></li>
</p>

<li>Click on <font color=darkorange>Pointing Control</font>. Here you can set the ALFA parameters and point the
telescope. If you have run TOGS, ALFA should be in place and the
telescope should be close to the correct azimuth. If you have not run TOGS, double-check that ALFA is in place. 
The telescope won't move until the receiver floor has
       finished rotating (to ALFA, from some other receiver).  Also note that the "Configure Wapps" will not work, 
       and you won't get data flowing from all the beams ( you can tell this from the alfadatawin program on the
       dataview machine.) 
<ul>
  <li>The source "catalog"
  <b>a2010.cat</b> will be already loaded. Check at the top of the window if this file is
       loaded, and, if not, load with the "Catalog" button (on the top
       left). If you have run TOGS, the "Source" will be listed as "galfasrc". You need to change it.
  <li> In the central box, you will see a list of the <font color=#darkblue>Visible sources</font>. If you
       don't see the one you want, click on <font color=#darkblue>All sources</font>
       Choose the appropriate drift***p* "source" corresponding to the
       current observing block from the list of drifts.
       You can also type the coordinates of the source (RA and Dec);
       if you do so, be sure to use epoch "equatorial J2000".
<li> If necessary, update the RA to the current LST. This can be done
       in a2010.cat before opening the <font color=darkorange>Pointing
       Control</font> menu.
<li> Click <b>Accept</b> 
      and continue with the following while the
       telescope points.
<li> Check that velocity is set to <b>0</b>, reference frame to <b>topocentric</b> and type to <b>optical</b>.
<li> If for some reason you need to, you can update the ALFA rotation using
       the <b> ALFA Rotation Control Window</b>. In the menu that
       pops up, set <b> Rotation angle </b> to +19.0 (degrees) and hit <b>Send</b>.
       You can actually see if ALFA is rotating by looking
       at the TV camera in the control room (ask the telescope operator to show the appropriate camera).  
       The blue number next to the "Send" button should change to your entry once ALFA reaches that position.
       (For drifts at 0 or 180 degrees azimuth, the correct angle to give equal Declination beam 
       spacing is thought to be 19 deg. At azimuth 90 deg, it is thought to be -14 deg.)
       Once ALFA has rotated into position, click <b> Close
       </b>. (Note that ALFA should be at 19 if you have run TOGS, but
  that we do this step to make sure.)
  <li> Check in the <font color=darkorange>Pointing Control</font> window,
  that the "ALFA center" is set to <b>0</b> to choose beam 0 as the ALFA center.
  <li> Note: if there are problems with ALFA not responding (e.g., it
  doesn't rotate), click <b>Restart ALFA </b> under the 
<font color=darkorange> Utilities </font> menu.
</ul>
</p>

<li>Restart the WAPPs under<font color=darkorange> Utilities</font> as above.
</p>

<li>Click on <font color=darkorange>Receiver IF/LO selection menu</font>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure that Receiver=<b>ALFA</b>, Filter choice=<b> Full width</b>,
       IF/LO path=<b>ALFA</b>, Center frequency =<b>1385.0</b>MHz,
       Backend=<b>WAPP</b>, WAPP bandwidths=<b>100</b>MHz, Configuration type=
       <b>Fast</b>, Radar blanker=<b>OFF</b>.
  <li> When ready, click <b> Accept</b>.
</p>
	
<li>Click <font color=darkorange>CIMA Observing Menu</font>. Ok, everything should be ready now. It's time
for one last check that you are ready.
<ul>
<ul> 
<li> Check that all values are properly set:
<li>  The<b> observing mode</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>Fixed azimuth drift map</font>
<li> <b> Number of loops</b> is set to cover length of run. Easiest to leave
it at the default <font color=#cc0f14>99</font>.
<li> <b>Strip time</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>600</font> secs.
<li> <b>Azimuth position</b> should be either  <font color=#cc0f14>180</font> degs
or  <font color=#cc0f14>360</font> degs. (Note 180 is equivalent to 540 and 
telescope will know to go to the closer angle, so you do not need to change to 540.)
<li> <b>ALFA rot angle</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>19</font> degrees (at least for now).
<li> <b>Start position</b> is the drift you want; if not, click on it to load another
from the catalog "a2010.cat", or to update the R.A.
<li> <b>Drift type</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>Follow Dec J2000</font>
<li> <b>Calibration type</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>Hcorcal</font>
<li> <b>Calibration time</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>1 sec</font>
<li> <b>Calibrate when</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>On @ loopend</font>
<li> <b>Add extra cal</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>No</font>
<li> <b>Adjust power</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>First loop only</font>
<li> <b>Loops per file</b> is <font color=#cc0f14>1 loop</font>
</ul>

<li> If you have moved at all since the last time, hit <b>Adjust Power Again</b>.
<li>Otherwise, hit <b>Observe</b> and make sure that the slew time is less than the wait time displayed
in the  <font color=#cc0f14>AO Observer Display</font>.
If not, hit "Abort" and set a slightly later RA. Start a new FITS
file just in case and hit <b>Observe</b> again.
</li></ul> </p>
 
<li>During observing, do the following (see <a href="#datam"> Data
Monitoring section </a> for useful tools):
<ul>
<li> <b> Monitor your data: </b> watch
particularly for power dips, GPS, birdies, and gaps in the data. 
Be vigilant for new sources of RFI; carefully check the waterfall plots and/or quicklook.</b>
Know the expected locations in the band of the "usual suspects". The
FAA radar is usually at 
1350 MHz (although they sometimes use 1330 MHz, out of our bandpass!)
For example, strong RFI at 1367 and 1382 MHz is due to the
Punta Salinas naval base radar, which should <b>not</b> be on during
ALFALFA run.

(see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Erfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html"> this link</a>).
<li> <b>Watch for WAPP errors </b> and follow procedure to <a href="#wapp"> recover from WAPP
errors </a> below.
  <li><b> Maintain a log file, </b> with an entry for each new fits
  file that is written. The file should be in /share/obs4/usr/a2010/ &nbsp ; 
      if it's not there, make one using the format logYYMMDD. <a
      href="#log"> More instructions </a> below.


<li> <b> Check the declination </b> on the monpnt window to confirm that it
 remains near the J2000 value (within a few arcseconds). 
    
   <li> If you abort a scan during the night with the "Abort" command
   in the <font color=darkorange>Spectral Line Observing</font>
   widget, be sure to <b>start a new fits file </b> before observing again; if you don't, the two scans (the one you aborted and the new one) will be in the same fits file, complicating the data reduction. 

<li> Sometimes the WAPPS are left in an uncertain state if a scan is aborted abruptly. Be sure
to <b>restart the WAPPs</b> after aborting a scan-in-progress (i.e. after data taking starts), and then make 
sure to <b>reconfigure</b> them. Unfortunately this means that you have to readjust the power, so you
really want to be careful not to abort needlessly. 

<li> See <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html">
observational troubleshooting list</a> for other observing issues.)

</li>


</ul>

</ul>

</p>

<li><b>Ending the Observations</b>
<ul>
<li>When finished, abort the last scan, after a few seconds of
integration time.
<li>If running TOGS (if not, skip to next step), 
<ul> <li> <b>Restart the WAPPS</b> using that option under  <font color=#cc0f14>Utilities</font>.
Note any error messages; if there are any, try again.
<li>Click on <font color=#cc0f14>Command File Observing</font>, and click the <b>Load</b> 
button.  Choose and <b>run</b> the script <b>command_galfacurpos</b>.  This will again load the togs.gui 
file and IFLO setup, and begin the TOGS calibration at the current telescope position.  Let the 
calibration finish (about 6 minutes) and then follow the exit procedure as normal.
</ul><li> Select <font color=darkorange>Exit normally</font> to exit
       CIMA. 
<li> Exit data monitoring programs.
<li> Log out of observer2.
<li> The operator will end the galspect process. (The procedure is 
to pull up the window running GALSPECT, and hit CTRL-C to exit.  Logout of 
the galfa1 machine and then exit dataview.)


</ul>
</ul>

<a name="wapp"></a>
<h3><font color=darkblue>Recovering from WAPP errors</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li> The only sign of WAPP errors in CIMA is that messages appear in <font color="red">red</font> in the
    CIMA log window. WAPP error messages include: <font color="red"><i>WAPPs confused</i></font>
    or <font color="red"><i>WAPP (3) ERROR - Counts don't match for chip 1</i></font>. The latter indicates
    a hardware problem on WAPP3. Occasionally there is no warning message from CIMA, but the countdown
    time on the aostatus window stops, meaning that the WAPPs are no longer taking data.
    Sometimes the problems go away, so try to restart
    the WAPPs and then the observing again. To do this:
    <ul>
        <li>Abort Observation in, e.g.,  the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu</font>
        <li><b>Restart ALL WAPPS </b>under <font color=darkorange> Utilities </font>
        <li><b>Configure WAPPs</b>  in <font color=darkorange>Backend Control</font>; bring up window and
           click on <b>Accept</b>
        <li>Adjust RA for new observation in the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu</font>. Click
            on <b>Start position</b> and then adjust the position in the 
           <font color=darkorange> Fixed azimuth drift map start position selection menu</font> when that
           window pops up. Be sure to click <b> Accept</b>
        <li><b>Adjust power</b> in the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu </font>
        <li>Start a <b>New File</b> in <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu </font>
        <li>Hit <b>Observe </b>  in  the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu </font>
        <li> Once drift starts, confirm coordinates. (Sometimes
	  control returns to telescope operator rather than observer.)
         </ul>
 If this does not work, try again, up to a few times. If this still does not help,
      exit CIMA and start again.
  If the <font color="red">error messages keep appearing</font>,  it will be necessary to have the operator call an engineer to
    look into the problem. Currently, the WAPP experts are Giacomo Comes, Arun and Ryan Seal.
</p>


   <li> If you abort a scan during the night with the "Abort" command in the 
<font color=darkorange>Observing menu</font> widget, be sure to start a new fits file 
before observing again; if you don't, the two scans (the one you aborted and the new one) 
will be in the same fits file, complicating the data reduction. 

<li> Sometimes the WAPPS are left in an uncertain state if a scan is aborted abruptly. Be sure
to <b>restart the WAPPs</b> after aborting a scan-in-progress (i.e. after data taking starts), and then make 
sure to <b>reconfigure</b> them. Unfortunately this means that you have to readjust the power, so you
really want to be careful not to abort needlessly.

<h2><font color=darkblue>Data Monitoring</font></h2>

Mikael has developed a great package for telescope monitoring and data
display. 
These programs read the data that are being broadcasted to the FITS files, and not
the FITS files themselves. The screens are updated every 10 seconds.<br>

On Dataview, click on the background and select from the menu:
<ul> 
  <li>Quicklook Data Display  -- launches the ALFA on-line display. Click 'ALFA Pattern' and 'Diagrams - Waterfall' to 
see all 7 beams 
  <li>Observers Monitor -- opens a widget that gives the power levels. Normal power levels are coded in blue.
  <li>Array Rotation -- shows ALFA rotation
      angle - check at beginning of night.
  <li>ALFA Beam Position -- shows approximate positions of each beam; can set to RA,Dec (note:
    currently, the positions aren't quite perfect but still helpful.) Check at beginning of night.
  <li>Frontend Monitor -- launches the ALFA instrument monitor,
		       showing voltages, currents, and temperatures
		       in all beams (same display as to the right of the operator's station)..

</ul>
You can open the same widgets by typing on an xterm on a linux machine:
<ul> 
      <li><b>alfadatawin</b> -- waterfall plots in your color of choice.  Too cool.  Enough said. 
      <li><b>alfaobswin</b> -- power for each beam
      <li><b>alfamotorwin</b> -- ALFA rotation angle 
      <li><b>alfabeamwin</b> -- beam positions
      <li><b>alfamonwin</b> -- instrument monitor 


</ul> 
The program alfadatawin is currently only available on Linux machines. The other commands are available
on other machines, too. Notice that you will not be able to start <b>alfadatawin</b> if the process 
is already running on dataview (started by one of the previous observers). If this happens, ask the 
telescope operator to contact Mikael, Arun, or Phil to kill the previous process(es).

<h3><font color=darkblue>Notes</font></h3>
<ul>

  <li> In particular, use these displays to monitor the power levels. Notice that after hitting
       "Observe" the CIMA monitor WAPP power levels <i>do not update</i>, whereas the monitoring windows 
       show the current levels.</p>

  <li> After a cal, the WAPP power levels will spike and so the
  displays will momentarily change scale.

  <li> If you reset the WAPPs, you will have to exit and restart alfadatawin to get it to grab 
       the online data again.</p>

  <li> To log out of dataview at the end of the observing run, close the windows "politely" by hitting 
       exit in each display window before logging out. This will make sure that the processes terminate.</p>
</ul>

<h2><font color=darkblue>Log files</font></h2>

It is very important to keep an accurate log of what happens, even to note "an uneventful night".  To do so:
<ul>
  <li> ssh to another machine as <i>a2010</i>
  </li><li> open a new file <b>logYYMMDD</b> in <b>/share/obs4/usr/a2010</b> using your favorite
text editor.  Use a posted log file as the template.
  </li><li> record **anything** of note, especially
<br>(1) the CIMA version number and the saved state (a2010_az360.gui or a2010_az180.gui)
    <br>(2) any bad files,
    <br>(3) any power adjustments,
    <br> (4) unusual rfi etc. (see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting list</a> to check
<br>To quote Brian: <i> I cannot stress the importance of keeping accurate logs.
While the file conversion software works automatically, it is good to have a backup to check against when
comparing scan numbers.  Sometimes CIMA squeezes in extra scans at the beginning or end of the run, or
has some other unpredictable behavior.  It is also important to note "empty" files, as IDL will hiccup on these.</i>
The folks who calibrate/process the drifts you take will thank you for your carefully note-taking (and will be entirely
justified in saying unkind things about you otherwise).
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p></p>



<br>

<h2><font color=darkblue>After Observing</font></h2>
After the run has finished, do the following things to keep the rest of the a2010 group informed about how the run is
going.

<ul>
<li> Follow the instructions in the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/todo_endrun.txt"> list of tasks to do after each
run </a>. &nbsp; Details about IDL portion are given below.
<li>Check with the scheduling team about other mods that they or you should make.
If anything <i>important</i> happened, send a message to RG and MH.

</ul>
<h2><font color=darkblue>Reading Data into IDL and saving to Disk</font></h2>
Once a observing session is complete, all the FITS files can be converted into a set of IDL structures for 
future use; ask Brian about any details about this. It is probably best to do this at your "office" workstation 
at AO, and run the job on one of the fusion machines. Below, IDL> means "inside idl".
<ul>
<li> Login as user a2010.  The  ".idlstartup" file in ~a2010 is configured with the proper routines, which are 
located in /share/a2010/idl and its subdirectories.
<li> Change to the data directory /share/a2010/data/<i>{run_directory}</i>  (ie /share/a2010/data/07.02.17/
<li> Filecreator needs as input a list of the FITS files with full path names that you wish to process.  The 
best way to do this is <pre> ls /share/pserverf.sda2/wappdata/wapp.YYYYMMDD.a2010.* > filesYYYYMMDD.txt </pre>  
This will put all the a2010 files from that date into the text
file. Check your log to confirm the directory.
<li> This next step is very, very, VERY important.  You MUST consult the log to see what files should be 
removed from this list.  If there are files that have no data (ie the files at the end of the run), they 
will cause the filecreator program to hiccup, and therefore should be removed from the list.  If there are 
files you KNOW contain junk, remove them from the list.  ALSO, if you run crossed over midnight, you may 
need to add or delete files.  You can ls, grep, do whatever you want to make the list, just make sure that 
the list contains all the viable files you wish to process for a
single observing run. Make sure that there is no blank line at the end
of the list, or filecreator will crash.
<li> Start up IDL in /share/a2010/data/<i>{run_directory}</i> by typing idl
Make sure that you are on 
a fast machine (fusion01, fusion02, aolc1,2,3,4,6,g,h,j,k,m,o,p), and
that someone 
else isn't using up all the cpu (do a
"top" to check that).
<li> IDL>@wasinit2  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (If this doesn't work, check that your idl account is <a
href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/idl_startup.txt">set up properly</a>)

<li> IDL> .com filecreator
<li> You are now ready to process a run's data.  There are five different file types that will be created:
<ul>
	<li>sssssssss.sav - A 600 second d structure *.sav IDL file
        <li>ssssssssCALOFbegin - The first record of a drift used as a cal off
        <li>ssssssssCALOFend - The last record of a drift used as a cal off
        <li>ssssssssCALON - A 1 second CALON
	<li>ssssssssCALOF - A 1 second CAL off 
</ul> 
<li> IDL> filecreator, filelist 
<li> filelist is a string of the filename you created
above, ie 'files20070223.txt'. 
<li>The files being created will be reported on screen as the job is done.  In addition, the names of the CAL
files will be written to the file 2007-MM-DD.CALlist.  This list is important, as it will form the calibration structures from the procedures
calib1 and calib2.
<li> <b>Example from February 23, 2007</b>:  There were 26 files made that night, so I created a list in the 
/share/a2010/data/07.02.23/ directory with ls
/share/pserverf.sda2/wappdata/wapp.20070223.a2010.*.fits >
files20070223.txt and ls /share/pserverf.sda2/wappdata/wapp.20070224.a2010.*.fits >>
files20070223.txt, because the run crossed midnight.  However, upon
examining the log I see that files 15 and 11 were aborted.  I removed
these files from the list, as they contain no data.  I then start IDL
with idl while on one of the fast machines listed above.  I compile
filecreator as above, and then invoke the command:
<li> IDL> filecreator, 'files20070223.txt'
<li> IDL goes to work.  When the job is done there will be many IDL save files, CALON files, and CALOFbegin and CALOFend files, the
filesYYYMMDD.txt you created, and a new CALlist file.

</ul>
