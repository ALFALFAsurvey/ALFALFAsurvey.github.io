<h3><font color=#008000>A2010 observer's quiz</font></h3>


<ol>
<li> What is the name of the directory where the a2010.cat file is found?
<li> What is the a2010 account alias to get you to that directory?
<li> How do you know what to observe tonight?
<li> How do you know when to start observing tonight?
<li> How do you know what progam is running right now?
<li> How do you know what receiver is being used right now?
<li> How do you know where the Gregorian dome is right now?
<li> What are the "tiedowns"?
<li> How can you tell if the tiedowns are active now?
<li> What is the "ALFA cover"? Why might it be on?
<li> Which machine do you use to startup "CIMA" when you observe?
<li> Which machine do you use for monitoring ALFA data (waterfall plots)?
<li> Which machine do you practice "CIMA" on? 
<li> Which machine do you run "filecreator" on?
<li> How can you tell if your VNC session is really dead?
<li> How many WAPPs are there?
<li> What is the central frequncy of the bandpass used for ALFALFA?
<li> How wide is the bandpass used for ALFALFA?
<li> What is the full bandpass of ALFA?
<li> In the standard A2010 setup, what frequency corresponds to channel 1761?
<li> What does "IF" stand for in "IF path"?
<li> What command gives you the display of the IF path?
<li> Why doesn't the azimuth of the dome exactly equal 180.0?
<li> What is the most recently measured total rms pointing error of ALFA Beam 0?
<li> Which of the two beams/pols 4A or 5A showed a lower system temperature
     consistently throughout the month of Jan 2011?
<li> What spectra does "quicklook" display?
<li> What is the difference between the red and green spectra displayed by "quicklook"?
<li> Why does "quicklook" display 8 panels of spectra?
<li> How can you distinguish rfi from GPS from rfi from Puntas Salinas?
<li> Halfway through a scan, you see some strange RFI at a frequency
     that does not correspond to GPS, Puntas Salinas, the FAA radar or
     a harmonic. Then it turns off. How can you find out what frequency 
     it is at (quickly,
     albeit not too accurately) and when it started/stopped?
<li> Just as a drift was coming to an end, you noticed WAPP errors and just after
     the next drift started, you aborted and restarted the observing. How can
     you tell whether the previous drift was ok?
<li> How can you figure out whether you were looking at a GPS satellite?
<li> If you notice bad/unexpected rfi, to what email addresses should you 
     send a message with details? What should you include in the message?
<li> You observe a continuum source: how can you find out what it is,
     how big it is, and its flux density at 1400 MHz?
<li> Your VNC connection dies. What do you do?
<li> You start seeing red errors or repeated orange ones indicating that
     there are WAPP logic buildup errors, e.g.<br>
     <i>WARNING WAPPDATA-wappdata: WARNING wappdata buildup logic error!<br>
     WARNING WAPPDATA-clear_all_pending: WARNING WAPPDATA confused --- cleared 7 dumps!<br>
     WARNING WAPPDATA-flush_pending: WARNING WAPPDATA flushing 74 dumps!</i><br>
     What do you do?
<li> You see one (or more) message(s) stating <i>"WARNING there are WAPP channels with too little 
     power (0.035 < 0.75)!"</i> What do you do?
<li> You see one (or more) message(s) stating, e.g.<br> 
     <i> "WAPPDATA-queue_agcdata: Received duplicate AGC-datablock
      at 01:36:15.297 (seconds:5775.29?)<br>
      WAPPDATA-search_agc: Extrapolating agc-data from 5774.0 to 5775.0!<br>
      WAPPDATA-search_agc: Interpolating agc-data over 2.00 second time gap (5774.0 - 5776.0)!</i><br>
      What do you do?
<li> You see one (or more) message(s) stating, e.g.<br>
     <i>WAPP=4-chip count: Counts don't match between chip 0 and chip1 (99999964 != 99999966  diff = 2)!</i><br>
     What do you do?
<li> In the standard meridian transit observing mode, what beam would observe the most northern possible
     declination?
<li> How fast does the azimuth slew?
<li> How fast does the dome move in zenith angle?
<li> How long does the TOGS script "galfa_curpos" run (from when you start it until it terminates)?
<li> "filecreator" appears to abort without writing the drift*list and cal*list files. What went
     wrong? How can you quickly create those files?
