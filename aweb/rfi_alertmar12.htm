Hello again Martha, et.al.  I have received another
email from our USSC contact in which he states:

----------------------------------------------------
Mert,

All things considered, I do not believe we'll be interfering with the
ALFALFA study on our backup days. I've taken a very close look at weather
forecasts and there's a low probability of needing the backup days and an
even lower probability that we would need the entire time span. We'll do
everything possible to avoid 1381 MHz transmissions 0000-0400Z on Thurs and
Friday this week. At this point, the only contingency that would drive
testing during that period would be a test equipment malfunction which is
unlikely.

Have a great day,
Steve
-----------------------------------------------------
So, it sounds like you are in the clear.  Happy observing!

This looks like trouble.</p>

1600-2400 AST    Mar 21: A2669 observes from 20h15 on 21 Mar<br>
1600-2400 AST    Mar 22: A2669 observes from 20h00 on 22 Mar<br>

Subject: Updated GPS-L3 (1381 MHz)  RFI Alert

From: Dan Mertely <dmertely@aoc.nrao.edu>

We have received additional detail from the US Space Command
(USSC), Colorado Springs, CO, informing the RA community of
upcoming, extended L3 test transmissions.  The observatories
should expect increased RFI @ 1381 MHz during the dates &
times indicated below (modified).

Of the fixed schedule observations showing a potential conflict,
A2669 at Arecibo appears during a potential back-up test date.
If the Arecibo schedulers believe that increased 1381 MHz RFI
will be debilitating for that observation, I could petition the
USSC for relief.

VLA & VLBA schedulers should attempt to schedule 1381 MHz use
around these times if possible.  Observing scientists should
be made aware of the increased possibility of corrupted data
on these dates and times.  VLA and VLBA operators should note
unusual L-band Tsys or total power fluctuations observed during
these times in the Operator Log forwarded to observers.
