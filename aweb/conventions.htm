<h2><font color=#cc0f14>ALFALFA Naming Conventions</font></h2>

<h2><font color=darkblue>The "designated" observer</font></h2>
The designated observer is the person responsible for carrying out the observations
on a given day, regardless of whether that person is actually the one driving the
telescope.</p>


<h2>
<font color=darkblue>The "designated" scheduler</font></h2>
The designated scheduler is the person responsible for assigning the declination
strip/pass to be observed on a given day.</p>


<h2><font color=darkblue>The "designated" data file monitor</font></h2>
The designated data file monitor is the person responsible for verifying the
existence of the raw fits files and performing their conversion to IDL .sav
files.</p>

<h2><font color=darkblue>Observing block designations</font></h2>
The block name is assigned according to the date <i> when
the observing block begins, in AST</i>. If there is any confusion, ask the
<i> designated scheduler</i>. Note that where there are two separate blocks
on the same day, one is designated "a" for "am" and the other "p" for "pm".
If there are more than 2 blocks, the designated scheduler will be creative...</p>

<h2><font color=darkblue>Drift nomenclature and corresponding declinations</font></h2>
The <a href="docs/alfalfa_driftmaster.txt">master list</a> contains the declination
assignments for each declination strip and pass for the entire ALFALFA survey.</p>
