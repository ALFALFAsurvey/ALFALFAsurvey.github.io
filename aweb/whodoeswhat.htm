<h2><font color=#cc0f14>Who is supposed to do what.....</font></h2>

<h2><font color=darkblue><li> The "designated" observer</font></h2>
The designated observer is the person responsible for carrying out the observations
on a given day, regardless of whether that person is actually the one driving the
telescope. Normally, the designated observer also performs the data file conversion
(FITS to IDL) and immediate data quality verification.</p>

<ol><b><font color=#cc0f14>Before observing</font></b>
<li> Check the telescope schedule in the control room to verify the times of the
     observing blocks.
<li> Check the <a href="scheds/a2010_schedupcoming.txt">block allocation schedule</a>
     <ul><li>Note the name of the "observing block". Use this exactly in naming
             files (<font color=#cc0f14>logYYMMDD and cimalogYYMMDD</font>)
             and directories (<font color=#cc0f14>data/mmdd/</font> for the moment). 
             See the A2010 <a href="conventions.htm">naming conventions</a> for details.
         <li>Note the <a href="docs/alfalfa_driftmaster.txt">declination</a> and 
             <a href="conventions.htm">drift/pass designation</a>
             to be observed during this block. Except in dire emergency, please follow the
             schedule; do not improvise. If there is any confusion, ask the
             <font color=darkblue><b> designated scheduler</b></font>.</ul>
<li>Check that the declination and drift/pass designation are correct for
    this date in the current observing catalog found at
    <font color=#cc0f14>/share/obs4/usr/a2010/a2010.cat</font>.If there is any 
    confusion, ask the <font color=darkblue><b> designated scheduler</b></font>.
<li>Create today's observing log file in /share/obs4/usr/a2010 as <font color=#cc0f14>logYYMMDD</font>,
    according to the block name, following the template /share/obs4/usr/a2010/log_template. While
    you observe, take good notes for which your colleagues will thank you.
</ol>

<ol><b><font color=#cc0f14>After observing</font></b>
<li> Rename the cimalog in /share/obs4/usr/a2010 to <font color=#cc0f14>a2010.cimalog.YYMMDD</font>.
<li> Copy both the cimalogYYMMDD and the log file logYYMMDD to /share/a2010/obslogs/monYY.
<li>Following the instructions in the <a href="checklista2010.html"> checklist</a>, create the
     list of input files <font color=#cc0f14>filesYYYYMMDD.txt</font> in
     the /share/a2010/fitsfiles/monYY directory</font>.
<li>Update the loglinks.htm file in ~a2010/public_html to point to the
correct location of the observing log, the cimalog and the fitsfile
list. 
<li> Edit the a2010.cat file in /share/obs4/usr/a2010, inserting a "#" at the beginning of
the line corresponding to the declination strip you just observed. (CIMA does not display
lines with the # in column 1, so this will make it easier for the next observer.)
<li> If you have agreed to do the file conversion, do it following the 
<a href="checklista2010.html"> checklist</a>.  This task should be coordinated with
the designated file monitor who bears responsibility for the task even if he/she does not
actually perform it.  If this does not appear to work properly,
notify Brian (bkent@astro.cornell.edu) and Riccardo (riccardo@astro.cornell.edu) immediately.
<li> If you have agreed to do it, verify the data quality; this normally means running CALIB1,
CALIB2 and BPD on at least a subset of the data. If anything appears unusual, discuss it
with someone!</ol>
<br>

<h2><font color=darkblue><li> The "designated" data file monitor &nbsp
(Martha/Ann)</font></h2>
The designated data file monitor is the person responsible for verifying the
existence of the raw fits files and their valid conversion to IDL .sav
files. Most often, the observer will perform the conversion, but the data file
monitor should verify this, and also verify that the files have been transferred
to Ithaca by the designated archivist. The observer, data file monitor and
archivist need to keep in close touch.</p>
<ol>
<li> Check that the observing log, the cimalog and the fitsfile list
have been properly created by the <font color=darkblue><b> designated
observer</b></font> and that they can be properly accessed via the link on the a2010
website. If there is any confusion, ask the <font color=darkblue><b> designated observer</b></font>.
<li> If the observer has not, copy the list of fitsfiles <font color=#cc0f14>filesYYYYMMDD.txt</font>
from <font color=#cc0f14>/share/a2010/fitsfiles/monYY</font> to the
directory where you will write the IDL files, <font
color=#cc0f14>/share/a2010N/data/MMDD</font>, i.e., <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp> cp /share/a2010/fitsfiles/monYY/filesYYYYMMDD.txt /share/a2010A/fitsfiles/monYY<br>
and make sure there is enough disk space left to write the new IDL files.
<li> If the observer cannot, convert the files to IDL following the instructions in the 
     <a href="checklista2010.html"> checklist</a>. If this does not appear to work properly,
     notify Brian (bkent@astro.cornell.edu) and Riccardo (riccardo@astro.cornell.edu) immediately.
<li> Check with the archivist to make sure that the files will be transferred to Cornell.</p>
</ol>
<br>

<h2><font color=darkblue><li> The "designated" scheduler &nbsp
(Martha/Ann) </font></h2>
The designated scheduler is the person responsible for assigning the declination
strip/pass to be observed on a given day.</p>
<ol><b><font color=#cc0f14>Before observing</font></b>
<li>Check the telescope schedules as soon as they are posted. Update the 
    block allocation schedule (using eggidl/gen/blocksched.pro) and post them to:
    <ul><li>~a2010/public_html/scheds
        <li>/home/web/research/projects/egg/alfalfa/scheds/asttimes (on rap)</ul>
<li>Update the graphical schedules (*.fig) by identifying the drifts now included
    in the block allocation schedule in yellow/gold as appropriate, export to *jpg 
    and post them to:
    <ul><li>~a2010/public_html/scheds/images
    <li>/home/web/research/projects/egg/alfalfa/scheds/images (on rap)</ul>
</ol></p>
<ol><b><font color=#cc0f14>After observing</font></b>
<li>Copy the various log filesto the team website:
    <ul><li>scp /share/a2010/obslogs/MonYY/cimalog* /var/www/html/alfalfalog/cimalogs (on cbrj)
    <li>/var/www/html/alfalfalog/fitsfiles (on cbrj)
    <li>/var/www/html/alfalfalog/logs (on cbrj) </ul>
<li>Update the graphical schedules (*.fig) by identifying the drifts now included
    in the block allocation schedule in green as appropriate, export to *jpg 
    and post them to:
    <ul><li>~a2010/public_html/scheds/images
    <li>/home/web/research/projects/egg/alfalfa/scheds/images (on rap)</ul>
</ol></p>
<br>

<h2><font color=darkblue><li> The "designated" archivist &nbsp
(Martha/Ann) </font></h2>
The designated archivist is the person responsible for transfering the raw IDL
save files to disk storage at Cornell and making a backup copy there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that with the designated data monitor that the files have been properly
converted to IDL.
<li>Copy them (scp) to a disk area in Ithaca. Record the disk location.
<li>Make a backup on a removable disk and record the backup date.
</ol></p>
