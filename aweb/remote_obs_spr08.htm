<h3>Current as of Feb 26, 2008</h3></center><br>
<center><i>PLEASE NOTE:  There are procedures for using VNC (Virtual Network Computing)</i></center>


<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">Things needed before observing</h3>
<ul>
 <li> laptop (for comfortable viewing of the AO status display) or other workstation....
 <li> observing checklist
 <li> this checklist
 <li> coffee or Diet Pepsi(TM), prosciutto sandwich, wings, Doritos(TM)... your choice.
</ul> 


<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">30 minutes before observing</h3>
<ul>
 <li><b>Call the telescope operator </b> at (+1) 787 878 2612, Ext. 211, and ask for the password for 
     user "dtusr" at "Observer2". Ask also for the status of ALFA (cover off? amplifiers on?
     all beams working? anything else new?...) </p>

<li><b>   ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b>   and enter the account password
<li>  <b>ssh dataview</b> and enter the account password once again
<li>  You are now logged into dataview.  To facilitate using two screens on the Linux machines, it is best to startup 
    two independent VNC server sessions. Enter the following at the command prompt TWICE:  
<br> <b>vncserver -geometry 1200x900</b> (or 1250x950 or 1250x1000 depending on desktop)
<li>  You will get a messages detailing what your new X Desktop numbers are - NOTE THE
 NUMBER AT THE END (usually a 1,2,3,4 or 5)
<li>  In another terminal window on YOUR local machine, issue this command
 to open your desktop: <br>
      <b> vncviewer -shared -via a2010@remote.naic.edu dataview:N</b>
 (<b>N</b> is the number of the X desktop.) 
 <li>In yet another terminal window, again on YOUR local machine, issue the same command - just change <b>N</b> to 
the other server desktop number.  In each instance, you will be prompted for two sequential passwords.  The first
 is the normal a2010 account password.  The second is the VNCserver password for the server desktops.  In the case
   of using two VNC server sessions, two desktops should pop up.  One session can be used to control CIMA, and the
  other can be used for the waterfall plots and any realtime IDL analysis.

<li>In another virtual window on your local machine or an a laptop, 
     login to AO using the a2010 account, and start the AO status display and the IF/LO andPointing Monitors:<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
	<b>aostatus</b><br>
	<b>monpnt</b><br>
        <b>rxview</b><br>
    These three items are not critical if they crash, therefore, they do not need to be run in the remote desktop.
    But, they are VERY useful so pay attention to them. They tell you what is **really** happening.<br>

<i>Note: See <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ephil/hardware/monitordoc.html"> Phil's web page</a> for how to access other telescope monitoring windows.</i></p>


<li> Keep an eye on the aostatus window, and have the a2010.cat (located in /share/obs4/usr/a2010/a2010.cat) file open for editing in your text editor of choice (pico or vi work well over the network).
As soon as the previous observer is out, check the LST, and estimate and add the slew time (usually around 5 minutes).
Put this in for the RA in the <i>galfasrc</i> entry and save the file.</p>

</ul> 

<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">Ready to go!</h3>
<ul>
 <li><b>Call the telescope operator and wait for the ok.</b> Only one session
     of CIMA can run on observer2 at a given time. <b>Tell the operator the approximate AZ,ZA you want so that
     he/she can start moving the telescope as soon as the previous program is done. Also ask him/her to
     set up GALSPECT.</b> <b> <i> Don't start CIMA until the telescope is close to position (once you start
    CIMA, the telescope motion will halt until you start the TOGS command file). </b></i>
<li>Use a terminal in one remote desktop to connect to observer2:<br>
         <b>ssh -X dtusr@observer2</b>  <br> and type in the password provided by the operator.
         
<li> Startup CIMA with the command <br> <b>cima --X</b> <br> and invoke the version we are currently using: 
the <b>"unusable engineering version of Cima (Ver 2.3.xx)"</b>  
(Version updated frequently - this version number current as of 08.01.14)

<li>After typing in <b>a2010</b> as the project name, your name as the observer name, and your phone number, 
     you will be authorized by the operator.
 <li>Follow the instructions in the <a href="checklista2010.html#cima">A2010 observing checklist </a> -
 go to Startup section, 'Start CIMA on-line GUI' instructions.
 <li>If you have problems (e.g. CIMA does not start, you can't select the receiver, the telescope doesn't move...)
     contact the telescope operator. 
</ul> 

<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">While observing</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Make sure the IF/LO is set up properly; check out the <b>rxview</b> display (which you started
      up at the beginning). You'd better be observing 100 MHz centered at 1385 MHz!
 <li>Once data-taking has begun, open Mikael's software for data monitoring on the other vncserver window. (If these
      tasks do not work, try restarting them.)<br>
     <b>alfaobswin &</b> - monitor the power in dB for each beam - leave this window up <br>
     <b>alfamotorwin &</b> - shows ALFA rotation angle - check at beginning of night<br>
     <b>alfabeamwin &</b> - opens alfabeampos widget, which shows ALFA beam positions - check at beginning of night<br>
     <b>alfadatawin &</b> -  waterfall, spectral, and total power plots. To see the waterfall plots, 
     click on 'ALFA pattern' and then 'Plot Type' and select 'waterfall' Note that you will not be able to 
     start <b>alfadatawin</b> if the process is already running on dataview (started
    by one of the previous observers). If this happens, ask the telescope operator to kill the previous process or, if
     he cannot, to contact Mikael, Arun, or Phil to do so.</p>

  <li>On another terminal, you can start up an IDL session on one of the fast linux machines
      (e.g. fusion01,02,aolc1,2,3,4) so that you can run "quicklook" as a backup to the waterfall plots. Note these instructions make use of the aliases
      in the a2010 account.<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@fusion01</b><br> (or fusion02)
     <b>cd /share/a2010/idl/eggidl</b><br>
     <b>idl</b><br>
     <b>@wasinit2</b><br>
     <b>quicklook,'filename'</b><br>
        where 'filename' is the complete name of the last complete FITS file,
        e.g. '/share/pserverf.sdb1/wappdata/wapp.20060914.a2010.0003.fits'. (The directory path is
        specified in the log files - look at the previous night's log.) You have the option to display
        the bandpasses for each beam, both pols of the first record of the file. Not as nice as
        Mikael's data monitoring, but quick and convenient for remote observers as an extra check or as backup
        if the data monitoring programs don't work.<br></p>


<li>Keep an eye on the remaining time until the end of the scan on the AO
    status display. Occasionally it might stop for no reason, meaning
    that the WAPPs are no longer taking data, and you will receive no
    error or warning messages from CIMA. <b> If WAPPS fail, see
    WAPPS Failue Section in <a href="checklista2010.html#wapp">A2010 observing checklist. </a></p></b>
 <li>Watch the "CIMA Observation Log Display" window, where error and
     warning messages are displayed. When you see messages concerning
     the WAPPs (e.g., <i>WAPP(N) DONE adjusting power</i>, 
     <i>WAPP(N) DONE with spectral line observation</i>, etc.), make
     sure that all four WAPPs are responding. Do not count on CIMA
     letting you know that one of the WAPPs has stopped working...</p>
 <li>Check periodically that the declination setting (J2000) is correct.
     For this, look at the <b>monpnt</b> window to be sure that the line
     starting with <b>Rslt:</b> shows the correct DecJ. Also check the
     appearance of the array and its coordinates in the alfabeampos widget,
     which is opened by the aflabeamwin task.
     If anything looks amiss, discuss with the telescope operator. In particular,
     <i> be sure that he has given you control of the telescope!</i></p>
 <li>Restart the WAPPS (1) before TOGS at the beginning of the night; (2) at
     A2010 startup; and (3) before TOGS at the end of the night.</p>
<li> Maintain the log - see the <a href="checklista2010.html#log">A2010 observing checklist</a>.
</ul> 

<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">Finishing Procedures, including VNC cleanup </h3>

<ul><li> <b> Run TOGS if time is allocated. </b> See instructions in <a href="checklista2010.html#finish">A2010 observing checklist</a>.

<li> <b> Exit out of CIMA, followed by exiting out of the observer2 computer. <i> It is important to do this
   as quickly as possible, so that the next observer can log in.</b> </i> 
<li><b>        Exit out of any IDL sessions and ALFA/CIMA utility programs </b>
<li> Kill both remote desktops (X in the upper right hand corner).
<li> In the window connected to dataview on your local machine where you started the VNC server, issue the following
        command to kill the sessions (you MUST do this):
       <b>vncserver -kill :N</b>
       where N is the desktop number
<li><b>Exit out of dataview and remote.naic.edu </b>
<li><b>Carry on with post-observing procedures, </b> summarized in <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/todo_endrun.txt"> 
list of tasks to do after each  
run </a> and <a href="checklista2010.html#afterobs">A2010 observing checklist </a>.  Finish your soda and Doritos.
