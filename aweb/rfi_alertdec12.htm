<h2><font color=#cc0f14> RFI alert for Dec 2012</font></h2>
<pre>
From: Dan Mertely <dmertely@aoc.nrao.edu>

We have received notice from the US Space Command (USSC),
Colorado Springs, CO, informing the RA community of
upcoming, extended L3 test transmissions.  The observatories
should expect increased RFI @ 1381 MHz during the dates &
times indicated below.  These transmissions are part of their
regularly scheduled, (quarterly) system tests.

VLA & VLBA schedulers should attempt to schedule 1381 MHz use
around these times if possible.  Observing scientists should
be made aware of the increased possibility of corrupted data
on these dates and times.  VLA and VLBA operators should note
unusual L-band Tsys or total power fluctuations observed during
these times in the Operator Log forwarded to observers.

Please contact me for coordination should any of these dates
and times conflict with planned radio astronomy observations.

This is not a problem for us. What about others?

2000-0400 UT => 1600-0000 AST    ok?<br>
2000-0400 UT => 1600-0000 AST    A2713 uses multifreqs; what is RAstr/yk= RadioAstron?<br>
2000-0400 UT => 1600-0000 AST    Dec 6/7: A2048 (AGES) observes from 1900-2100 on 06Dec<br>
</p>
I have written to Mert asking him to point out the conflict to our
friends at Space Command.</p>
