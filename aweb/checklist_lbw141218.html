If the CIMA version/time stamp is not as appears above (one or the other has changed a few times in
the last week), check the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~cima/cima_users_log.html">CIMA
User's Log</a> to see what has happened. Presumably any changes made would not apply to us; don't
take the adjective "stable" too literally.<p></p>

This is a short checklist of the things to do when observing with LBW as part of the ALFALFA followup observations. <br>
Remote observers: see the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/remote_lbw.htm"> LBW remote observing checklist </a> (Note: instructions are almost
the same as for A2010/ALFA except of course when it comes to the specifics).<br>
<!--
For general issues, see the ALFALFA
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting</a>
page.<br>
-->
It is always a good idea to check with recent observers about their experiences.

<center><b>Important points about ALFALFA followup observing with LBW</b></center>
<ol>
<li> We use a single mode of correlator
     setup, using Doppler tracking to center the spectrum at a particular heliocentric velocity.
     The configuation file will be the same every night; only the command file containing the observing sequence will change. See the
     <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/scheds/a2010_schedupcoming.txt">A2010 schedule</a> page.
</li><li> We still use the a2010 user account (to login, etc), but the observing 
     program name is different. In Oct 2014, the observing program is called <b>"a2899"</b>. You can navigate, 
     as user a2010, to the observing file directory by typing <b>"a2899obs"</b> in any window.
</li><li> We use <b>LBW</b> (the L-band wide receiver; not ALFA). Therefore, there are <b>no waterfall plots</b>.
</li><li> We use the WAPPs as the spectrometer, but in a different mode. Each of the 4 WAPPS is set to observe a 25 MHz width,
          instead of the whole 100 MHz ALFALFA frequency range. Read about the 2014
     <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/lbw_observingmodes.htm">observing modes</a>.
</li><li> We use different software routines to monitor the data. You'll have to follow the instructions; see below!
</li><li> The good news is that the observing sequence is executed using a <b>command file</b>. Once you set up the
     receiver and the correlator and start to run the command file, the observing sequence will run automatically,
     moving from source to source and running the ON-OFF sequence for each one smoothly (but again, you need to 
     pay attention!).
</li><li> The observing program for a2899 consists normally
     of a series of 3-minute ON-OFF "pairs", one for each galaxy followed automatically by 
     a CalON/CalOFF sequence which takes 20 seconds; observing each target "pair" takes about 8 minutes plus slew time. 
     Then it's time to look at the resulting spectrum to see if there is a galaxy lurking there!
</li><li> During each observing block, the observing sequence will be executed by running a command file 
     called <b>"a2899_YYMMDD.cmd"</b>, found in the observing directory "/share/obs4/usr/a2899". We also use only
     one configuration file: <b>a2899.conf</b>.
</li><li> Additionally, in the "/share/obs4/usr/a2899/nov14" directory, 
     you will find two other files for your use:<br>
     <ul> <li> <b>a2899logYYMMDD</b>: a template log file for the night. Please fill in/correct as necessary. Be sure
               to look at some <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/logs_spr13.htm"> old log files</a> for examples, 
         e.g. <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/obslogs/mar13/a2752/a2752.cimalog.130321">one example</a>
          </li><li> <b> a2899_YYMMDD_nominal.txt</b>: an <i>approximate</i> schedule for the night. Notice that the times here are
               <i> ONLY APPROXIMATE</i> and that the given azimuths are for the source not the dome.</li></ul>
</li><li><font color="#cc0f14"><b>NOTE THIS!!!!</b></font> &nbsp; If there is any chance of rain or fog,
ask the operator to disable the tiedowns. In March
2013, bad baselines occurred when there was some rain and/or fog because one or more of the distomats was not
recording. The symptom: bad baselines with 1 MHz periodicity. Solution: disable the tiedowns. If unsure, discuss
with the operator, but we are thinking that the best solution is simply to disable them. Read Phil's
explanation <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/phil_tiedowndisable.txt">here</a>.
</li><li> Your job includes (a) watching that the telescope does what it is supposed to; (b) making
     sure the timing of the observations stays roughly on schedule; and (c)
     making a quick check of the result for each galaxy to see if there
     is a detection; hence you will have to keep track of what is going on!
</li><li> (Left over from the ALFALFA survey days:) &nbsp; 
We do not run TOGS; there is no commensal observing, and so (we presume), no need for a cell phone.

<h2><font color="#cc0f14">Startup:</font></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Ask the telescope operator to move the telescope to the Az,Za of the first source and select LBW as soon
       as the previous observation is finished. Note that the Az of the <b>source</b> is given in the 
      <b> a2899_YYMMDD_nominal.txt</b>, but you need to add/subtract 180 degrees for the Az of the dome. (If you
       are observing remotely, you should have already done this when you called the operator 30 min in advance.)<p></p>

  </li><li> If there is any chance of rain/fog, ask the telescope operator to <b> disable the tiedowns</b>. Read Phil's
       explanation <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/phil_tiedowndisable.txt">here</a>.<p></p>

  </li><li><b>Log into OBSERVER2: dtusr</b>  (once the previous observer is done). Password is taped to computer (or
         get it from the operator in advance).<p></p><br>

  <a name="cima"></a>
  </li><li><b>Start CIMA on-line GUI</b>:<br>
  <ul> 
    <li>Type <b>cima --X</b> in an available window. Select the desired version of
    CIMA; this is currently <b>"The Stable version (Default) (Ver 3.3.13 2014-05-08 17:14")" </b>
    </li><li>Project Number: <b>a2899</b> (note: even if you type "A", CIMA will change it to "a" when you click "Line") 
    </li><li> Observer: <b> your name </b>  (for entry into operator's log book) 
    </li><li> select <b>Line</b> and <b>Accept</b>
  </li></ul><p></p><br>

Several other windows will also open: the <b>CIMA log display window</b> and the <b>CIMA observation status</b> window.
Leave them open through the night.<p></p><br>

  </li><li>The <b>Receiver selection menu</b> will open. 
        Choose Receiver: <b>L-Band Wide</b> and <b>Accept</b>.<br>
        Make sure that L-wide shows up in the aostatus monitor. Leave the default options as is:<br>
        <ul><li>Make quick Tsys measurement: <b>No</b><br>
        </li><li>Rotate receiver into position: <b>Yes</b><br>

        <p></p><br>
 
  </li><li>In the CIMA main menu, under <b>Utilities -&gt;Load configuration </b>(file)
     <br>Load the appropriate a2899 configuration file: <b>a2899.conf</b><br>
        This corresponds to the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/lbw_observingmodes.htm"><b>search mode</b></a> in our terminology.<p></p>

      you are using, so it's a good idea to check.</i><br> 
      Currently, we are using one basic observing mode (in the past, we sometimes used a second one, but not now).<br>
      Note that because some of the WAPPS boards may be bad, the rest frequency of each board may be slightly different than
      the picture below.<br>
      However, there should be one board at each of the four frequencies below (at approximately 1415, 1395, 1375, and 1355 MHz).<br>
      <i>If you determine a different board is bad while observing, you'll need to return here to make changes!</i><p></p>

<h2><font color="#cc0f14">While Observing:</font></h2>

<ul>
<li> As soon as you start observe, run some immediate quick checks.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Check that the telescope is actually at the correct declination </b><br>
           1. Check the declination displayed in the <b>CIMA observation status window</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
           <font color="#cc0f13">Always check this!</font><br>
           2: Check the "Rslt" line in the <b>monpnt</b> window (the upper right window on the screen
            below the frequency band monitor). Dec value should stay within a few
            arcseconds of the drift value. &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#cc0f13"> Always check this!</font>
    </li><li> Check the receiver is centered at the right frequency via the <b>"Observer's On-line IF/LO Graphical
         Display"</b> (the "rxview" command if you are running remotely). <i> NEED TO ADD SCREENSHOTS FOR a2899 HERE!</i><br>
         First line: &nbsp; L-band wide &nbsp; center frequency = 1420.0 MHz (this may change a very small amount)<br>
         2nd line: &nbsp; Receiver filters: &nbsp; 1320 hipass  &nbsp; <i> should show 1320 to 1788 MHz</i><br>
         3rd line: &nbsp; IF path: &nbsp; 10GHz to 1500 &nbsp; <i> The whole thing will be green</i><br>
         Bottom table: &nbsp; IF band setup<br>
         <img src="a2899searchrxview.png" height="500"><p></p>
                 Note: the center frequency of the band in "rxview" display will
           change very slightly during observing due to heliocentric correction.<br>
         <font color="#cc0f14">If something went wrong and you had to re-apply the configuration, this display may look wrong, with 100 MHz bandwidth windows, like <a href="a2899searchrxview_bad.png"> this</a>.<br>
         <b> Do not panic!</b> It is just a lag in the rxview window and will correct itself once you begin integrating on the first source.</font>

    <p></p>
    </li></ul>
<br>
</li><li>
<a target="_blank" name="log"></a>
<b>Keep the log file </b>- it is very important to keep an accurate log of what happens, even to note "an uneventful night".  
<i>Note: log files will be generated in advance for each night's observing. Use the one appropriate for your run.</i>
<ul>
  <li> To keep the log, ssh to another machine as <i>a2010</i> and then type <b>a2899obs</b> to get to the a2899 observing directory.
  </li><li> Find the log file <b>a2899logYYMMDD</b> in <b>/share/obs4/usr/a2899/MONTH14</b> and edit it 
       using you favorite text editor (vi or pico work well when remote observing; emacs is too
       slow, unless you use the '-nw' flag to open in a terminal.) 
   </li><li> Check that the setup is what is indicated in the log file, i.e. the CIMA version number and the configuration file.
   </li><li> Keep track of the approximate LST start, the file number and the <b>ON-source scan number</b> for each pair.
   </li><li> Check and note any rfi in the observing band. Be especially vigilant for new sources of RFI, and
        know the expected locations in the band of the "usual suspects". The
        FAA radar  is usually at 1350 MHz (although they sometimes use 1330 MHz, out of our bandpass!).
        Strong RFI at 1367 and 1382 MHz is due to the
        Punta Salinas naval base radar, which should <b>not</b> be on during ALFALFA run 
        (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/~rfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html"> this link</a>.) . 
        If you see this, ask the operator to 
        call Punta Salinas immediately and tell them to turn off their equipment! 
        See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/troubleshooting.html"> 
        observational troubleshooting list</a> for other observing issues.)
   </li><li> After each pair, take a quick look at the resultant ON-OFF spectrum (see IDL instructions following).<p></p></li></ul><br>

   </li><li><b> Keep track of the timing</b> (but remember that the nominal timing we predict is only approximate so don't
        expect it to be exact!)<br>
        In the directory with the log file (/jun4 in this case), there 
        is a file called <b>a2899_YYMMDD_nominal.txt</b>
        which contains an estimated schedule of tonight's observations. <b>It is not precise!</b>. For example it assumes
        a start time and a slew from some arbitrary position; the run may start earlier or later than that. It contains
        estimated slew times and scan tracking times and hence the Az and ZA of the source at the expected time of observation.
        Note that the Az here is the Az of the source, not the Az of the dome. The ZA of the source and dome should be
        close, but the Az will be off by about 180 degrees (or some multiple of that). Use this file as a guide. If you
        find that the actual observing times are falling behind, you
        may need to skip a source. Or if you are ahead or behind and
        the ZA is approaching 18, you may need to skip or repeat a source. Also, in general, there
        may be extra sources at the end. If you seem to have a gap, it is also ok to do a source twice.<p></p>

    <b><font color="#cc0f14">What if the timing gets out of whack (e.g. you start late, something crashes etc)???</font></b><br>

        If you want to repeat or skip a source, you have two
        choices. You can either <b> Stop </b> or <b> Abort. </b> <b>
        Stop </b> will finish the current observation and then halt. <b>
        Abort </b> will immediately halt the observation. Once the process
        completes, click on the GOTO line of the source you want (or
        enter the line number on the left side where it says "<b>Start from</b>")  and
        hit  <b> Run</b>. 

        Alternatively after an <b>Abort </b> you may reload the commmand file, make sure
        First Line is selected, and hit <b>Run. </b> After it sets things up, 
        it waits for 10 seconds (the  <b>WAIT 10</b> line in the command file). As soon as it starts to wait the 10 seconds,
        hit <b>Stop</b>. Quickly identify the proper line in the file to
        pick up the source at which you want to start observing
        (e.g. a "GOTO" line). Click on it or enter the line number to
        left and hit <b>Run.</b> 
        Skipping or repeating sources is definitely something you want to practice
        using CIMA offline before your first night of observing.<p></p>

   </li><li><font color="#cc0f14"><b> Determine if the current board setup is OK</b></font><br>It is quite possible that some of the WAPPS boards may fail,
   leaving less than all of them working correctly. You should be able to determine whether this is the case after looking at
   the first source with <b>lbwquicklook</b> (see below) regardless of whether it was detected or not. Note that, unlike previous
   LBW observations with the interim correlator, you <b>do not need to wait until the next source begins</b> before running
   <b>lbwquicklook</b>! In fact it is very important that you don't wait, so you can fix the boards before starting another source.<br>
   <ul><li><a href="lbwquicklook_bad3.png">This</a> lbwquicklook screenshot shows a bad board 3. The order of the boards in lbwquicklook is always the same, regardless of the specific frequencies they are set to.
       <li>If one board is bad, but is already assigned to 1355 MHz, do nothing.
       <li>If one board is bad, but not assigned to 1355MHz, do the following:
       <ul><li>Press <b>Stop</b> to pause observing before the second source starts.
           <li>Open <b>Set-up->Receiver IF/LO selection menu</b> and rearrange the rest frequencies so that the bad board is at 1355.405751 MHz.
           <li>Press <b>Apply</b> in the IF/LO selection menu, and wait for things to set up.
           <li>Continue your observing by finding the next source in the command file, and pressing <b>Run</b>.</ul>
       <li>If two boards are bad, do the above, but assign one to 1355 MHz, and the other to 1415 MHz.<br><br></ul>

   </li><li><b> Check the spectrum produced by each ON-OFF pair</b>Part of your job is to make a quick review of whether the
        source was detected, at what velocity and also to note the presence of any RFI, bad baselines etc.<br>
        Open an IDL session on fusion00 (or aolc1, ...) and run <b>@wasinit</b> to compile the WAPPS utilities, and
        <b>@lbwinit</b> to compile the LBW observation checking program.<br>
        This observing mode takes four times as much data as the previous LBW follow-up, so these files take some time to load!<br>

<!---
When observing in high velocity mode, it is useful to plot boards
3 and 4 separately. To do this, run another idl session and do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>openr, lun, '/share/olcor/corfile.13jan14.a2899.1', /get_lun</b>&nbsp <i>Use the relevant corfile</i>=-lp
        <li><b>io=corposonoff(lun, b, /han, /scljy)</b> &nbsp <i> Takes ON-OFF/OFF, scales in 
Jy; Keeps boards separate; Boards 1&2 are the boards we care about</i>
        <li><b>bavg=coravg(b, /pol) </b> &nbsp <i> Averages the two polarizations; Boards 1&2 (separate 
polarizations) are combined into a single board</i>
        <li><b>corsmo, bavg, bsm, smo=3 </b> &nbsp <i> Smooths via boxcar over 3 channels; maybe also want to try 9 channels</i>
        <li><b>corplot, bsm, brdlist=2, xtitle='Velocity (km/s)',ytitle='Flux (Jy)'</b> &nbsp <i> Plots the smoothed spectrum; Plot the combined board 3&4 (brdlist=2)</i>
        <li><b>ver, y_low, y_high</b> &nbsp <i> Optional: Sets the vertical scale between y_low and y_high. Then execute <b>corplot</b> again.</i>
        <li><b>close, lun &amp free_lun, lun</b> &nbsp <i> Closes the corfile</i></p> 
        </ul>
--->

        Check <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/checkpair_lbw.htm">here</a> for a more thorough discussion of what is done in this script.
        Be sure to record in the log file all useful information about the resultant spectrum, e.g.  presence of any RFI, bad baselines etc
        and whether (or not) the source is detected; if it is, record the approximate central channel and frequency AND velocity of the HI line. Also, make a judgement call as to whether the signal to noise is good enough or whether the source needs to be reobserved.
If you want to, follow the instructions at the UAT
<a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/ugradteam/lbw/lbw_reduction.htm">LBW reduction instructions</a> page to   
measure the RMS, HI line flux density, velocity and W50. If possible, include an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio
(just compare the peak HI line emission to the rms noise in the baseline region; a guess-timate is all that's needed!).
The more info you put in the log, the better for our planning for the next observing session!<p></p>
</li></ul>

<a target="_blank" name="finish"></a>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14">Finishing up:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> If the command file finishes, then you are done. Usually we include a couple of extra sources at the end,
to be done if there is time. If the time allocated for a2899 is up in less than 10 minutes, you should abort the command
file.
</li><li>Exit CIMA normally
</li><li>Exit the observer2 machine
</li><li>Exit data monitoring programs "nicely"
</li><li>Exit IDL (if you were using it)
</li><li>Exit out of the dataview machine
</li><li>If remote observing, follow the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/remote_lbw.htm%22">procedures</a> to close down the VNC connections when you
    are ready to do that..<p></p>
</li></ul>

<a target="_blank" name="afterobs"></a>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14">After observing...</font></h2>

Here, we're assuming the date is 20 Oct 2014. Change as necessary.<br><br>

Open a terminal on an Arecibo machine (i.e. remote.naic.edu):
<ul>
<li> Copy/move the command file and the log files (CIMA log and observer log) to the log archive and the web area:<br>
<font color="#cc0f14">Adjust this as appropriate for your observing date</font><br>
     <b>a2899obs</b> <i>(If this alias fails, then cd /share/obs4/usr/a2899/)</i><br>
     <b>mv a2899.cimalog_20141020 oct14/a2899.cimalog.141020</b> &nbsp; <i>notice the name format, please; adjust date for today.</i><br>
     <b>mv a2899_141020.cmd oct14</b><br> 
     <b>cd oct14</b><br>
     <b>cp a2899.cimalog.141020 /share/a2010/obslogs/oct14/</b> <i>(Note that the directory is a2010, not a2899!)</i><br>
     <b>cp a2899log141020 /share/a2010/obslogs/oct14/</b><p>

</p></li><li> Determine which FITS are <i>good</i>, that is, which correspond to completed observations. In the same directory
as above, make a list of them and write it to a file like <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/fitsfiles/jun14/files20140612.txt">this</a>, named "filesYYYYMMDD.txt". The list should
include all good files for the run, <b>both detections and 
non-detections</b>; it is used to determine which corfiles should be copied 
over to their final resting place at Cornell.
To make the file, you can issue commands similar to these:
<br><b> ls /share/pserverf.sda3/wappdata/wapp.20141020.a2899.*.fits &gt; files20141020.txt
<br>ls /share/pserverf.sda3/wappdata/wapp.20141021.a2899.*.fits &gt;&gt; files20141020.txt<br>
</b>
<br> You will only need the second line if you crossed midnight. Then edit the file to remove any bad files, e.g. if the observations of objects 1-10 were fine, but something failed during 11 and the run was restarted and 45 total objects were observed then it might contain only corfiles 1-10, 12-45. Be sure you get the date right; it may
change during the night. Once this file is ready, copy it to the web area:<br>
      <b> cp files20141020.txt /share/a2010/fitsfiles/oct14/</b><br>

<p>
</p></li><li> Update the log links file:<br>
     <b>aweb</b> <i>(This alias points to /home/a2010/public_html/)</i><br>
     Open <b>loglinks.htm</b> and update the references to the log, CIMAlog and the
     list of corfiles that you made in the previous step.<br>
     Go to the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/loglinks.htm">loglinks</a> page and check that your update worked.
</li></ul>
