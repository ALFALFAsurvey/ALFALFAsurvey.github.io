<center><h2 style="color: rgb(10,10,150);">ALFALFA Remote Observing Checklist: 
Current as of February 12, 2006</h2></center>

<br>
<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">Things needed before observing</h3>
<ul>
 <li> laptop (for comfortable viewing of the AO status display) or other workstation....
 <li> observing checklist
 <li> this checklist
 <li> coffee or diet pepsi, prosciutto sandwich, wings, junk food... your choice.
</ul> 


<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">30 minutes before observing</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Call the telescope operator at (+1) 787 878 2612, Ext. 211, and ask for the password for 
     user "dtusr" at "Observer2". Ask also for the status of ALFA (cover off? amplifiers on?
     all beams working? anything else new?...) </p>

 <li>Set up your laptop (or another workstation), 
     login to AO using the a2010 account, and start the AO status display:<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
     (the "X" variable sets up all the environment variables relevant
     for the transmission of graphics accross the link).<br>
     <b>aostatus</b> <br>
     and the pointing monitor <br>
     <b>monpnt</b></p>

Note: See Phil's web page for how to access other telescope monitoring windows.</p>

<li> <b><font color=#008000>NEW!</font></b>  Keep an eye on the aostatus window, and have the a2010.cat file open for editing.
As soon as the previous observer is out, check the LST, and estimate and add the slew time (usually around 5 minutes).
Put this in for the RA in the <i>galfasrc</i> entry and save the file.</p>

 <li>On your workstation you will need to use 2 desktops, which will
     be very creatively referred to as Desk1 and Desk2. </p>

     On Desk1 open a terminal, login to AO using the a2010 account, and start rxview
     to monitor the status of the IF/LO system:<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
     <b>rxview</b></p>

     On Desk2 open a terminal, login to AO using the a2010 account,
     and ssh into observer2 using the dtusr account (and the password
     given to you by the telescope operator):<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
     <b>ssh -X dtusr@observer2</b><br>
     You will use this terminal to run CIMA.
</ul> 

<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">Ready to go!</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Call the telescope operator and wait for the ok. Only one session
     of CIMA can run on observer2 at a given time. Tell the operator the approximate AZ,ZA you want so that
     he/she can start moving the telescope as soon as the previous program is done. Also ask him/her to
     set up GALSPECT.
 <li>Start CIMA on observer2 - Invoke the version we are currently using <b>Evolved version</b> 2.1. Type the following

<pre>
>  cima --X
</pre> 


     and then choose the new <b>"Normal Version 2.1"</b>.  
After typing in <b>a2010</b> as both the project and observer name, you will be authorized by the operator.
 <li>Follow the instructions in the <a href="checklista2010.html">A2010 observing checklist</a>.
 <li>If you have problems (e.g. CIMA does not start, you can't select the receiver, the telescope doesn't move...)
     contact the telescope operator. 
 <li>On Desk1 open another terminal and run Mikael's software for data
     monitoring. You have to do this on the dataview machine:<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@dataview</b><br>
     <b>/home/cima/bin/alfaobswin &</b> - shows the power in dB for each beam<br>
     <b>/home/cima/bin/alfamotorwin &</b> - shows ALFA rotation angle<br>
     <b>/home/cima/bin/alfabeamwin &</b> - shows ALFA beam positions<br>
     The waterfall and spectral plots could be seen by typing 
     <b>/home/cima/bin/alfadatawin &</b>, but unfortunately, that slows things
     down too much. Do NOT open it.<br>
  <li>On another terminal, likewise login and start up an IDL session on one of the fast linux machines
      (e.g. fusion01) so that you can run "quicklook". Note these instructions make use of the aliases
      in the a2010 account.<br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@remote.naic.edu</b><br>
     <b>ssh -X a2010@fusion01</b><br>
     <b>cd /share/a2010/idl/eggidl</b><br>
     <b>idl</b><br>
     <b>@wasinit2</b><br>
     <b>quicklook 'filename'</b><br>
        where 'filename' is the complete name of the last complete FITS file,
        e.g. '/share/pserverf.sdb1/wappdata/wapp.20050706.a2010.0003.fits'. You have the option to display
        the bandpasses for each beam, both pols of the first record of the file. Not as nice as
        Mikael's data monitoring, but quick and convenient for remote observers.<br>
</ul> 


<h3 style="color: rgb(70,130,180);">While observing</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Keep an eye on the remaining time until the end of the scan on the AO
    status display. Occasionally it might stop for no reason, meaning
    that the WAPPs are no longer taking data, and you will receive no
    error or warning messages from CIMA.
 <li>Watch the CIMA "AO Observer Display" window, where error and
     warning messages are displayed. When you see messages concerning
     the WAPPs (e.g., <i>WAPP(N) DONE adjusting power</i>, 
     <i>WAPP(N) DONE with spectral line observation</i>, etc.), make
     sure that all four WAPPs are responding. Do not count on CIMA
     letting you know that one of the WAPPs has stopped working...
 <li>Check periodically that the declination setting (J2000) is correct.
     For this, look at the <b>monpnt</b> window to be sure that the line
     starting with <b>Rslt:</b> shows the correct DecJ. Also check the
     appearance of the array and its coordinates in the alfabeampos widget.
     If anything looks amiss, discuss with the telescope operator. In particular,
     <i> be sure that he has given you control of the telescope!</i>
 <li>Restart the WAPPS (1) before TOGS at the beginning of the night; (2) at
     A2010 startup; and (3) before TOGS at the end of the night.
</ul>
