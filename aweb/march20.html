<h2>WAPP problem - March 20, 2005</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Project A2010
<li>Fixed Az drift mode
<li>File wapp.050320.a2010.0010.fits - beam 3 died in the ending cal scan.  See <b><a href="wappdead.ps">PS plot</a>.</b>  Xaxis - channel, yaxis intensity, boards 1-8 going left to right and down.  Board 4 (Beam 3 has no power at this point)
<li>CAL scan = 507908686
<li>Received error:  <b>WAPP(2) ERROR counts don't match for chip 2 error again.</b>
<li>Attempted to restart WAPPs, socksend WAPPDAT FLUSH, etc.  No result on multiple attempts.  Call to M. Lerner - said to be a hardware problem.  Call to Joe Hagen - referred to Bill Sisk, and message left with Bill.  Willy Torres restarted the wapps (hardware restart).  We receive a CIMA message concerning the sockets for WAPP2.  Restarting fresh in CIMA - same result, except now for all "chips" whether we restart in the WAPPs in CIMA or not.  Status still the same as of 4:15 AM AST.
