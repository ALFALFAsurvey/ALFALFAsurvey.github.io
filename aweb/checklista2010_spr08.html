Find the 2007 version <a href="a2010obs_instr_2007.html"> here</a>.
Starting in Jan 2008, we are upgrading to CIMA Version 2.3/3.0 which has
many new features, the most important of which are:
<ul><li> You need to start CIMA by typing <b>"cima --X"</b>
<li> Instead of a "saved-state" (.gui), we now use a "configuration file" (.conf) which sets
up all the observing configuration parameters, not just the IF/LO. Therefore <b> there are
fewer steps involved in setting up than before</b>.
     <li> <b>"Help"</b> info is available by right clicking on any widget or parameter
     <li> The sources in your catalog which are "visible" are indicated along with
              their current location, slew time, etc. 
     <li> It is possible to launch the system monitoring widgets from within CIMA.
     <li> <b>"Accept"</b>  is the same as <b>"Apply"+"Dismiss"</b> 
     <li> The <b>scan number convention</b> has changed to ydddNNNNN.fits where
          <b>"y"</b> is the year number, <b>"ddd"</b> is the day number within the
             year and <b>"NNNNN"</b>  is a sequential number which now has nothing to do
             with the time. Note also it has nothing to do with the FITS file number.</b>

This is a short checklist of the things to do when
observing... for more details see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/a2010obs_instr.html">the observing cookbook</a>. <br>
Remote observers, see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/remote_obs.htm"> remote observing checklist </a>.
<br>In case of observational problems, see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting list</a>.
<br>And, it is always a good idea to check with recent observers about their experiences.

<h2><font color="#cc0f14">Startup:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>  Ask the telescope operator to move to the azimuth and approximate zenith angle of the drift you're
    doing. This can either be 360 degrees (NOT 0) or 180 degrees (540 equivalent) depending
    on whether the drift tracks north of zenith (Decl &gt; +18d; use AZ =&gt; 180) or south of zenith
    (Decl &lt; +18d; use AZ = 360). But... <b>be sure the operator
    gives you back telescope control!</b>  Alternatively, go to the "Pointing Control" window
    and point the telescope to the first position; just be sure the telescope goes to Az=360,
    not 0 if observing the southern part of the sky (to avoid wrap problems).  Usually the best way
    is to have the telescope operator send the telescope to the approx
    AZ, ZA <b> before (tell him/her)</b> he/she starts
    up GALSPECT. <b> <i> If so, don't start CIMA until the telescope is close to position (once you start
    CIMA, the telescope motion will halt until you start the TOGS command file.) </i></b>
<p></p>

</li><li> Open up the catalog file <font color="#cc0f14">
/share/obs4/usr/a2010/a2010.cat</font> (shortcut: a2010obs) and estimate (including slew time) when the 
telescope will be on the meridian.  Edit the TOGS entry called galfasrc to the new right ascension 
and declination for that night. Adjust the RA entry by estimating as the previous
observer is finishing, and again during setup if there are delays, when the telescope will be on the 
meridian.
<p></p>

<i>
</i></li><li><i><font color="#008000">LET THE OPERATOR DO THIS STEP!</font> On the dataview machine do the following to start GALSPECT:
    <ul>
    <li>Login to dataview using the a2010 account.  Switch to the guest account via <b>ssh -l guest dataview</b>.  You 
must do this as
        guest.
    </li><li>In the same xterm window ssh to the galfa1 machines.  <b>ssh -i galfa_key galfa@galfa1</b>.  You should see a '#' prompt.
    </li><li>Warm up GALSPECT via typing <b>/var/diag</b>
    </li><li>Type the command:  <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  If you get the message <i>LO2:  Set failed, got back:  ERROR setting freq</i>, 
then you need to start the gpib on the wapp server.  To do this, start CIMA and click <b>Restart GPIB</b> under the
    Utilities menu (the old, non-recommended way to do it is to pull up another xterm, and ssh to the wappserver via 
<b>ssh wapp@wappserv</b>.  Ask Brian for the password.  Once logged on, type <b>source /home/cima/Wapp/Bin/Progs/Start/start_gpib</b>).  Go back to the 
xterm logged into galfa1 and again type <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  You should not receive an error.
</li><li>Enter the command <b>/var/togs</b>.  This will run for the rest of the night, so minimize the windows.<br>

<font color="#cc0f14"><i>Note: if the operator is not able to get GALSPECT to run, he/she should call the

</li><li> <b>Start CIMA on-line GUI </b>when telescope is close to start position. At the moment, you need
    to type <b>cima --X</b> in an available window. (In the future, at Arecibo, you might be able to
    start CIMA up by right-clicking on screen background, but not while we are using a non-default version).
   Select the desired version of
    CIMA; this is currently "an unusable engineering version 2.3.XX" 
    (as of 08.01.14; sometime in the next few months, this will eventually become version 3.0).

adjust starting RA on galfasrc entry in a2010.cat. 
   </li><li> Click <b> Run</b> to run the command file. The telescope will slew to requested position and, 
when it reaches the meridian, TOGS calibration will run for ~6 minutes.

<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> When Observing:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a name="log"></a>
<b>Keep a log file </b>- it is very important to keep an accurate log of what happens, even to note "an uneventful night".  To do so:
<ul>
  <li> ssh to another machine as <i>a2010</i>
  </li><li> open a new file <b>logYYMMDD</b> in <b>/share/obs4/usr/a2010</b> using you favorite
text editor (vi or pico work well when remote observing; emacs is too slow, unless you use the '-nw' flag to open in a terminal.)  
Use a posted log file as the template.
  </li><li> record **anything** of note, especially 
<br>(1) the CIMA version number and the saved state (a2010_az360.gui or a2010_az180.gui) 
    <br>(2) any bad files, 
    <br>(3) any power adjustments, 
    <br> (4) unusual rfi etc. (see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting list</a> to check 
for notes about specific RFI frequencies.)
<br>To quote Brian: <i> I cannot stress the importance of keeping accurate logs.  
While the file conversion software works automatically, it is good to have a backup to check against when 
comparing scan numbers.  Sometimes CIMA squeezes in extra scans at the beginning or end of the run, or 
has some other unpredictable behavior.  It is also important to note "empty" files, as IDL will hiccup on these.</i>
The folks who calibrate/process the drifts you take will thank you for your carefully note-taking (and will be entirely
justified in saying unkind things about you otherwise).

</li></ul>
<p></p>

</li><li><b>Be vigilant for new sources of RFI; carefully check the waterfall plots and/or quicklook.</b>
Know the expected locations in the band of the "usual suspects". The
FAA radar  is usually at 1350 MHz (although they sometimes use 1330 MHz, out of our bandpass!).
Strong RFI at 1367 and 1382 MHz is due to the
Punta Salinas naval base radar, which should <b>not</b> be on during ALFALFA run 
(see <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Erfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html"> this link</a>.) . If you see this, ask the operator to 
call Punta Salinas immediately and tell them to turn off their equipment! 
See <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> 
observational troubleshooting list</a> for other observing issues.)

</li>

<p></p>
<li><b>Between loops:</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Check power levels periodically. </b>They should stay in the range (0.8,1.2) and be coded 
        <font dark="" blue=""> blue </font> on the dataview observer's monitor. Note any odd power level
         variations in log. (Remote observers: be sure to note in log that you checked periodically.) 
        <b>Do not adjust the power levels during a run unless absolutely necessary; be sure to make a 
           clear note in the log file if you do so; it is necessary to process separately drifts done 
           before and after the adjustment,
           so make sure the processer can tell from the log file how to group the drift files.</b>
    </li><li>Keep track of the times, file numbers, scan numbers for drift and cal and any notes in the log file. 
    </li><li>Keep an eye on the declination on the monpnt window on
           the right hand console to make sure it is the same (within
           a few arcsec) of the desired J2000 declination.
    </li></ul> <p></p>

</li><li><b>File Integrity: Check the FITS files to make sure the coordinates are being written correctly.</b>  
     Use the IDL program <b> quicklook </b> in the directory /share/a2010/idl/eggidl. Run @wasinit2 first, then <br>
    IDL&gt;  quicklook, '<i>filename</i>'
    <br> where 'filename' is the name of the fits file, with directory path. The directory path can
      be found in the log file, e.g., /share/pserverf.sda3/wappdata/wapp.20061116.a2010.0011.fits
    <br>     This is fast and is good to use while remote observing. &nbsp <font color=magenta><i> The
             disk location change!</i>  As of 2008Mar04, it is being written to "pserverf.sdb1"; this can be
             reached via the "wdata2" alias under "a2010".</font></li><p></p>


<li><b><b>Data Monitoring:</b>
    </b><ul>    <li>Use the widgets provided on the dataview computer. When you
are in the control room, you can start them from the pull-down menu on
the dataview machine; be sure that the "CIMA version" is set to what
you want. Alternatively, you can open the widgets by typing the
following commands on an xterm: <ul>
      <li><b>alfamonwin</b> &amp; - same display as to the right of the operator's station
      <li><b>alfamotorwin</b> &amp;- shows ALFA rotation angle - good to check at start
      <li><b>alfabeamwin</b> &amp;- shows approximate positions of each beam; 
    can set to RA,Dec (note: currently, the positions aren't quite perfect but still helpful.)
      <li><b>alfaobswin</b> &amp;- smaller window showing the power in dB for each beam
      <li><b>alfadatawin</b>
&amp;- waterfall plots in your color of choice (select ALFA pattern,
then waterfalls from the pull-down menu under diagrams). Too cool.
Enough said. </li></ul> The latter two (alfadatawin and alfaobswin) are
particularly useful in monitoring the data and should be left up in
plain sight.<br>

    <li>Notice that you will not be able to start <b>alfadatawin</b> if the process is already 
    running on dataview (started by one of the previous observers). If this happens, ask the telescope 
    operator to kill the previous process or, if he cannot, to contact Mikael, Arun, or Phil to do so.
    </ul> <p></p>

<li><b><b>If there is a power failure...</b>
   There is a remote "reset" switch for ALFA - it is no longer necessary to go up to the dome and push the reset button.
</b>
</ul>

<a name="wapp"></a>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> If the WAPPs get confused...which WILL happen:</font></h2><font color="#cc0f14"> </font>
    The only sign of this happening in CIMA is that messages appear in <font color="red">red</font> in the
    CIMA log window. WAPP error messages include: <font color="red"><i>WAPPs confused</i></font>
    or <font color="red"><i>WAPP (3) ERROR (or WARNING) - Counts don't match for chip 1</i></font>. The latter indicates
    a hardware problem on WAPP3. (Note that the message
    "WAPPDATA-queue_agcdata: WARNING received duplicate
    AGC-datablock," appearing in orange, is not a WAPP error.)
 Occasionally there is no warning message from CIMA, but the countdown
    time on the aostatus window stops, meaning that the WAPPs are no longer taking data.
    Sometimes the problems go away, so try to restart
    the WAPPs and then the observing again.
    <ul>
    <li>Procedure: (Operations via "observing menu", unless otherwise indicated.)
          <ul>
    <li>Abort Observation in, e.g.,  the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu</font>
        <li><b>Restart ALL WAPPS </b>under <font color=darkorange> Utilities </font>
        <li><b>Configure WAPPs</b>  in <font color=darkorange>Backend Control</font>; bring up window and
           click on <b>Accept</b>
        <li>Adjust RA for new observation in the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu</font>. Click
            on <b>Start position</b> and then adjust the position in the 
           <font color=darkorange> Fixed azimuth drift map start position selection menu</font> when that
           window pops up. Be sure to click <b> Accept</b>
        <li><b>Adjust power</b> in the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu </font>
        <li>Start a <b>New File</b> in <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu </font>
        <li>Hit <b>Observe </b>  in  the <font color=darkorange> CIMA observing menu </font>
        <li> Once drift starts, confirm coordinates. (Sometimes
	  control returns to telescope operator rather than observer.)
         </ul>
 If this does not work, try again, up to a few times. If this still does not help,
      exit CIMA and start again.
  If the <font color="red">error messages keep appearing</font>,  it will be necessary to have the operator call an engineer to
    look into the problem. Currently, the WAPP experts are Giacomo Comes, Arun and Ryan Seal.</p>

<b>See the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/todo_endrun.txt"> list of tasks to do after each  
run. </a> </b>  Some details about IDL:
<p>


<b>Reading Data into IDL and saving to Disk</b>
<br> Once a observing session is complete, all the FITS files are converted into 
a set of IDL structures for future use. The a2010 ".idlstartup" file 
is configured with the proper idl routines to do this; the routines are located in /share/a2010/idl 
and its subdirectories. Ask Brian about any details. 
It is probably best to use your "office" workstation at AO, and run the 
job on one of the fusion or other fast machines. Below, IDL&gt; means "inside idl".
</p><ul>
<li><b> Login as user a2010 on a fast machine. </b> 
The fast machines are fusion01, fusion02, aolc1,2,3,4,6,g,h,j,k,m,o,p. Be sure
that someone else isn't using up all the cpu (do a "top" to check that - look at the memory line and
compare machine memory to memory currently available).
</li><li><b> Change to the data directory /share/a2010-2/data/<i>{run_directory}</i>  
(e.g., /share/a2010-2/data/05.08.17/)
</b></li><li> Filecreator needs as input a list of the FITS files with full path names that 
you wish to process.  The best way to do this is <pre><b> 
ls /share/pserverf.sda3/wappdata/wapp.YYYYMMDD.a2010.* &gt; filesYYYYMMDD.txt </b></pre>
(Adjust directory as necessary.)  
If the block actually crossed midnight, you'd add the files with the next date too.
 <pre><b> 
  ls /share/pserverf.sda3/wappdata/wapp.YYYYMMMDD.a2010.*.fits &gt;&gt; filesYYYYMMDD.txt </b></pre>

</li><li><b> This next step is very, very, VERY important.  You MUST consult the log to 
see what files should be removed from this list. </b> If there are files that have no 
data (e.g., the files at the end of the run), they will cause the filecreator program 
to hiccup, and therefore should be removed from the list.  If there are files you 
KNOW contain junk, such as files collecting data when the WAPPs failed, remove them from 
the list.  ALSO, if your run crossed over midnight and
you were observing the night before, you may need to delete files.  
</li><li><b> Start up IDL in /share/a2010-2/data/<i>{run_directory}</i> by typing "idl" </b>
</li><li><b> IDL&gt;@wasinit2   </b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (If this doesn't work, check that your idl account is <a href="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/%7Egalaxy/idl_startup.txt">set up properly</a>)
</li><li><b> IDL&gt; .com filecreator </b>
</li><li>You are now ready to process a run's data.  There are five different file types 
that will be created:
<ul>
<b>        <li>sssssssss.sav - A 600 second d structure *.sav IDL file
        </li><li>ssssssssCALOFbegin - The first record of a drift used as a cal off
        </li><li>ssssssssCALOFend - The last record of a drift used as a cal off
        </li><li>ssssssssCALON - A 1 second CALON
        </li><li>ssssssssCALOF - A 1 second CAL off 
</li></b></ul>
</li><li><b> IDL&gt; filecreator,'filelist' 
</b></li><li>filelist is a string of the filename you created
above, e.g., 'files20050208.txt'. 
</li><li>The files being created will be reported on screen as
the job is done. In addition, the names of the CAL files will be
written to the file 2006-MM-DD.CALlist. This list is important, as it
will form the calibration structures from the procedures calib1 and
calib2. If there were any WAPP warnings, you may come up
short of the 600 seconds. You will need to throw this file out.
</li><li>Example from February 7:  There were 33 files made that night, so I created a list in the
/share/a2010/data/02.07/ directory with ls
/share/pserverf.sda3/wappdata/wapp.20050207.a2010.* &gt; files20050207.txt.  However, upon examining the log I see
that file 25 was aborted.  I    
removed this file from the list, as it contains no data.  I then start IDL with "idl" while on one of the
fast machines listed above.  I compile filecreator
as above, and then invoke the    
command:
<br> IDL&gt; filecreator, 'files20050207.txt'
<br>IDL goes to work.  When the job is done there will be many IDL save files, CALON files, and CALOFbegin and
CALOFend files, the
filesYYYMMDD.txt you created, and a new CALlist file.
