<br>
This is a short checklist of the things to do when observing with LBW as part of the ALFALFA followup observations. <br>
Remote observers: see the <a href="remote_lbw.htm"> LBW remote observing checklist </a> (Note: instructions are almost
the same as for A2010/ALFA except of course when it comes to the specifics).<br>
<!--
For general issues, see the ALFALFA
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting</a>
page.<br>
-->
It is always a good idea to check with recent observers about their experiences.

<center><b>Important differences between ALFALFA followup observing with LBW and A2010 drift scan observing with ALFA</b></center>
<ol>
<li><font color=#cc0f14>New for March 2012:</font> &nbsp The mode for high velocity sources is slightly modified; you don't
     need to do anything different but be sure to load up the proper configuration file for your night. See the
     <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/scheds/a2010_schedupcoming.txt">A2010 schedule</a> page.
<li> We use the same user account (to login, etc), but the observing 
     program name is different. In spring 2012, the observing program is called "A2669". You can navigate, 
     as user a2010, to the observing file directory by typing "a2669obs" in any window.
<li> We use LBW not ALFA. Therefore, there are <b>no waterfall plots</b>, <b>no `quicklook'</b>,
     <b>no FITS files</b>, etc,  and the frequency
     range covered by the bandpass will shift around depending on the <a href=" lbw_observingmodes.htm">observing mode</a>
     and the heliocentric velocity of the target source.
<li> We use the "interim correlator" not the WAPPs as the spectrometer. The bandwidth is also narrower,
     and may shift around. We actually record four sets of spectra one of each of the four correlator "boards".
     Under most conditions, we will actually use only the first two boards; the others are recorded to monitor
     RFI and to look for sources where a detection is not confirmed. Read about the Spring 2012
     <a href=" lbw_observingmodes.htm">observing modes</a>.
<li> We use different software routines to monitor the data. You'll have to follow the instructions; see below!
<li> The observing program consist of a series of 3-minute ON-OFF "pairs", one for each galaxy followed automatically by 
     a CalON/CalOFF sequence which takes 20 seconds; observing each target "pair" takes about 8 minutes plus slew time. 
     Then it's time to look at the resulting spectrum to see if there is a galaxy lurking there!
<li> During each observing block, the observing sequence will be executed by running a command file 
     called <b>"a2669_YYMMDD.cmd"</b>, found in the observing directory "/share/obs4/usr/a2669". 
<li> Your job includes (a) watching that the telescope does what it is supposed to; (b) making
     sure the timing of the observations stays roughly on schedule; and (c)
     making a quick check of the result for each galaxy to see if there
     is a detection; hence you will have to keep track of what is going on!
<li> The good news is that the observing sequence is executed using a <b>command file</b>. Once you set up the
     receiver and the correlator and start to run the command file, the observing sequence will run automatically,
     moving from source to source and running the ON-OFF sequence for each one smoothly (but again, you need to 
     pay attention!).
<li> We do not run TOGS; there is no commensal observing, and so (we presume), no need for a cell phone.

<h2><font color="#cc0f14">Startup:</font></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Log into OBSERVER2: dtusr</b>  (once the previous observer is done). Password is taped to computer (or
         get it from the operator in advance).</p><br>

  <a name="cima"></a>
  <li><b>Start CIMA on-line GUI</b>:<br>
  <ul> 
    <li>Type <b>cima --X</b> in an available window. Select the desired version of
    CIMA; this is currently "The 'smart' version of CIMA (3.1.08 2010-02-01 17:44 "Smart")"  
    <li>Project Number: <b>a2669</b> (note: even if you type "A", CIMA will change it to "a" when you click "Line") 
    <li> Observer: <b> your name </b>  (for entry into operator's log book) 
    <li> select <b>Line</b> and <b>Accept</b>
  </ul></p><br>

Several other windows will also open: the <b>CIMA log display window</b> and the <b>CIMA observation status</b> window.
Leave them open through the night.</p><br>

  <li>The <b>Receiver selection menu</b> will open. 
        Choose Receiver: <b>L-Band Wide</b> and <b>Accept</b>.<br>
        Make sure that L-wide shows up in the aostatus monitor. Leave the default options as is:<br>
        <ul><li>Make quick Tsys measurement: <b>No</b><br>
        <li>Rotate receiver into position: <b>Yes</b><br>
        <li>Retrack source if selected: <b>Yes</b>
         </ul>
        </p><br>
 
  <li><b>Utilities->Load configuration file</b>
     <br>Load the appropriate a2669 configuration file: (There will be more than one; check which one you are
         supposed to use for the current session).<br>  <ul>

      you are using, so it's a good idea to check.</i><br> 
      There will be one setting per observing
      session, and two basic settings depending on the frequency range we are using. We normally concentrate on the first two correlator
      boads (1 and 2); the second set are used for monitoring purposes or to achieve higher resolution
      according to the <a href="lbw_observingmodes.htm"> observing
      mode</a>. The first mode, used
      for the lowest velocity sources (cz < 2000 km/s), 
      uses a fixed 25 MHz bandpass ("topocentric" with no velocity specified) 
      centered at 1420 MHz; the source then will move around in the bandpass,
      depending on its actual cz.  The second mode, dubbed "high velocity", moves the bandpass
      around according to the velocity of the source. Please be sure you know which one you are using.<br>

           1. Check the declination displayed in the <b>CIMA observation status window</b> &nbsp &nbsp 
           <font color=#cc0f13>Always check this!</font><br>
           2: Check the "Rslt" line in the <b>monpnt</b> window (the upper right window on the screen
            below the frequency band monitor). Dec value should stay within a few
            arcseconds of the drift value. &nbsp &nbsp <font color=#cc0f13> Always check this!</font>
    <li> Check the receiver is centered at the right frequency via the <b>"Observer's On-line IF/LO Graphical

    </ul>
<br>
<li>
<a target="_blank" name="log"></a>
<b>Keep the log file </b>- it is very important to keep an accurate log of what happens, even to note "an uneventful night".  
<i>Note: log files will be generated in advance for each night's observing. Use the one appropriate for your run.</i>
<ul>
  <li> To keep the log, ssh to another machine as <i>a2010</i> and then type <b>a2669obs</b> to get to the A2669 observing directory.
  <li> Find the log file <b>a2669logYYMMDD</b> in <b>/share/obs4/usr/a2669/MONTH12</b> and edit it 
       using you favorite text editor (vi or pico work well when remote observing; emacs is too
       slow, unless you use the '-nw' flag to open in a terminal.) 
   <li> Check that the setup is what is indicated in the log file, i.e. the CIMA version number and the configuration file.
   <li> Keep track of the approximate LST start, the file number and the <b>ON-source scan number</b> for each pair.
   <li> Check and note any rfi in the observing band. Be especially vigilant for new sources of RFI, and
        know the expected locations in the band of the "usual suspects". The
        FAA radar  is usually at 1350 MHz (although they sometimes use 1330 MHz, out of our bandpass!).
        Strong RFI at 1367 and 1382 MHz is due to the
        Punta Salinas naval base radar, which should <b>not</b> be on during ALFALFA run 
        (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Erfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html"> this link</a>.) . 
        If you see this, ask the operator to 
        call Punta Salinas immediately and tell them to turn off their equipment! 
        See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> 
        observational troubleshooting list</a> for other observing issues.)
   <li> After each pair, take a quick look at the resultant ON-OFF spectrum (see IDL instructions following).</p></ul><br>
   <li><b> Check the spectrum produced by each ON-OFF pair</b> - Part of your job is to make a quick review of whether the
        source was detected, at what velocity and also to note the presence of any RFI, bad baselines etc.<br>
        Open an IDL session on fusion00 (or aolc1, ...) and run <b>@corinit</b> to compile the corfile utilities, and
        <b>@lbwinit</b> to compile the LBW observation checking program.<br>
        The correlator files are written to <i>/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N</i> 
   <ul> <li>To check a particular corfile<br>
            <b>checklbw, file='/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N'</b> where <i>N</i> is the number at the end of the corfile
        <li>To show both polarizations of the data:<br>
            <b>checklbw, file=/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N', /pol</b>
        <li>To show spectral data from all four boards <i>(Low velocity mode only)</i><br>
            <b>checklbw, file=/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N', /all</b><br>
        <li>To change the number of channels used in smoothing to <b>X</b> (default is 3)<br>
            <b>checklbw, file=/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N', smo=X</b><br>
        <li>To display the velocity scale in stead of the frequency scale in <b>X</b><br>
            <b>checklbw, file=/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N', /vel</b><br>
        <li>To change the yscale <br>
            <b>checklbw, file=/share/olcor/corfile.DDmmmYY.a2669.N', yrange=[-30,50]</b><br>
</ul>
When observing in high velocity mode, it is useful to plot boards
3 and 4 separately. To do this, run another idl session and do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>openr, lun, '/share/olcor/corfile.23mar12.a2669.1', /get_lun</b>&nbsp <i>Use the relevant corfile</i>
        <li><b>io=corposonoff(lun, b, /han, /scljy)</b> &nbsp <i> Takes ON-OFF/OFF, scales in 
Jy; Keeps boards separate; Boards 1&2 are the boards we care about</i>
        <li><b>bavg=coravg(b, /pol) </b> &nbsp <i> Averages the two polarizations; Boards 1&2 (separate 
polarizations) are combined into a single board</i>
        <li><b>corsmo, bavg, bsm, smo=3 </b> &nbsp <i> Smooths via boxcar over 3 channels; maybe also want to try 9 channels</i>
        <li><b>corplot, bsm, brdlist=2, xtitle='Frequency (MHz)',ytitle='Flux (Jy)'</b> &nbsp <i> Plots the smoothed spectrum; Plot the combined board 3&4 (brdlist=2)</i>
        <li><b>ver, y_low, y_high</b> &nbsp <i> Optional: Sets the vertical scale between y_low and y_high. Then execute <b>corplot</b> again.</i>
        <li><b>close, lun &amp free_lun, lun</b> &nbsp <i> Closes the corfile</i></p> 
        </ul>

        Check <a href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/checkpair_lbw.htm">here</a> for a more thorough discussion of what is done in this script.
        Be sure to record in the log file all useful information about the resultant spectrum, e.g.  presence of any RFI, bad baselines etc
        and whether (or not) the source is detected; if it is, record the approximate central channel and frequency/velocity of the HI line.</p>

<a target="_blank" name="finish"></a>
<h2><font color=#cc0f14>Finishing up:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> If the command file finishes, then you are done. Usually we include a couple of extra sources at the end,
to be done if there is time. If the time allocated for A2669 is up in less than 10 minutes, you should abort the command
file.
<li>Exit CIMA normally

     e.g. if the observations of objects 1-10 were fine, but something failed during 11 and the run was restarted and 45 total objects were observed:<br>
     1-10, 12-45

     Enter the list of corfiles that you made in the previous step.<br>
     Go to the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/loglinks.htm">loglinks</a> page and check that your update worked.
