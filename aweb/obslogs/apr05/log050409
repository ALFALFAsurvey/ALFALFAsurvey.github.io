There is nothing worth keeping!

This night was a complete bust. First, we tried to run a command file
using LBW on the VLA target, but had weird CIMA problems. So, rather than
waste time, we decided to switch to drifts. Started up, but had repeated
WAPP errors every 4-7 minutes. Arun was working on one of the WAPPS (3).
He did a hard reboot of WAPP1 also. After almost 3 hours of repeated
failures we gave up. Apparently this is a more serious WAPP problem as
several other programs have also been cancelled.
