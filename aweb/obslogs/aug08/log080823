Notes: 
** TOGS run at end, but not at beginning - see next note.

** Problems with ALFA rotation during setup delayed start by about an hour. TOGS script timed out
at ALFA rotation command. Operator then attempted to rotate ALFA manually, but rotation angle registered
as +18.39 rather than +19. Restarted CIMA and tried TOGS again, but script failed immediately at the
rotation command. Restarting ALFA and cycling power to motors did not help. Operator called Phil. 
Phil found that rotation program was 'dead'. After fixing this, he got ALFA to +19. I restarted CIMA
and since it was past 22h, went directly to a2010 config. Script seemed to run normally, but crashed
again on rotation. Phil found same problem with rotation program and cleared it. He had me restart CIMA
and manually set rotation in Pointing Control and then try again. Finally worked. He has no idea what
caused this. I sent a report to Mikael.

**Almost continuous orange WAPP chip count mismatch errors throughout nite (numbers off by a little more
than 2000): WAPP=3-chip_count: WARNING counts don't match between chip 0 and chip 6 (99999966 !=
100002014)!  Quicklook shows no obvious problems. (But cimalog file is a lot bigger than usual.)
This continued through end TOGS, even after WAPPS restart.

**bandpass for beam 6B drops for frequencies lower than 1380 MHz
