Notes
0. TOGS run at start  (PROBABLY BAD; SEE BELOW) and end (okay)
1. FAA radar off, not much RFI
2. Beam 6B power levels okay, but bandpass looks strange: no gain between 1340-1360, gain at 1430 = 2 (instead of 1.5), and can't see galactic HI...
3. At start, got warning messages about WAPP chip count: the difference between the numbers was ~2000, so re-started a few times and they went away...
4. Got "duplicate AGC block warning - interpolated over 2 second gap" a few times too - see above
5. LOTS STARTUP PROBLEMS: Lost an hour of time at the start. Two main reasons: 
#1: When you point the telescope in the Pointing Control Window, the "Start Position" in the CIMA observing window does not change from the default of drift4p1: you have to click this buttongin the CIMA observing window and choose the drift you want there as well. Otherwise, the telescope tries to go to drift4p1 irrespective of what you did in the pointing window. This took a few tries to figure out.
#2: Strange pointing problems: Once the telescope was pointed in the Pointing Control Window and the "Start Position" was correct in the CIMA observing window, when I hit "Observe" the declination changed from the value in the Pointing Control Window: specifically, although +055024 was specified in the pointing control menu and the telescope was in fact pointed at that location, after I hit "Observe" it slewed to +055013 (or so) before starting to take data (this dec was listed in the CIMA obs status, monpnt window, and ZA did change, so I think it was real). I tried everything to fix this: re-loading the config file, restarting the wapps, exiting and re-entering CIMA. Called the operator: he had not seen this problem before. Finally resigned myself to take data at wrong dec all night, when dec corrected itself half-way into second drift (fits 0007). For this reason, files 0006 and 0007 are probably bad, but I'm not sure...
