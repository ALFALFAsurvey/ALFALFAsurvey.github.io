NOTE: The schedule changed! We were only on until 1:00 a.m. AST, so we would not complete the full RA block.
I made sure tomorrow's observers know!

END LST: 2253

Notes: 
TOGS not run at beginning due to late start.
Problem with ALFA motor; operators were able to manually rotate ALFA to 19 degrees, but had to call
a technician to replace the motor amplifier. Delayed until 9:20 AST/22:23 LST. Technician
could arrive at any time, so we started observing just in case we could get a little good data.

Was able to complete 3 drifts but then the technician arrived and  needed to go up on the platform.
They were still working on it within 20 minutes of the end of the A2010 observing
period, so I shut down and went home.
