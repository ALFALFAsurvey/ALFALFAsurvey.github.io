TOGS ran at start and end.

NOTES:

(0) CIMA and WAPP software changes. 
    Notice new CIMA version (2.2.11). Buttons to restart the GPIB socket communication (for 
    GALSPECT) as well as the ALFA control software have been added to the "Utilities" menu 
    in all CIMA versions. 

    WAPP software upgrades. Mikael has fixed the problem that was producing all those
    "WARN observing when not on source" messages without a good reason. See Miakel's  CIMA 
    users log file for details. As of this evening, no such warnings will appear on the CIMA
    logs. On the other hand, if you do get such warning, this really means that you are taking 
    data and the telescope is 10 arcsec or more away from where it is supposed to be.

(1) RFI at 1380.0-1380.2 MHz, very weak, strongest in beams 4A and 5A (where it is
    just visible -- but it is in all beams and both pols if you look carefully). 
    Present the whole night, strong only in one occasion. Sent RFI report.

(2) Something very strange happened: the FAA radar disappeared from beam 6! A better look
    shows that the x axis for beam 6 only, both pols, changed to the range 200-300 MHz (!). 
    Both waterfall and spectrum displays show the same thing. Power levels ok, no error messages, 
    nothing unusual on any other screen. Everything back to normal at the start of the 
    new FITS file. I looked at the FITS file using quicklook in idl and it shows the same problem,
    so it looks like the data were written with the wrong frequencies. Actually, the spectrum looks 
    like the usual 1335-1435 MHz but reversed. If so, maybe this fits can be corrected/recovered?
    Emailed Mikael and Phil (Cc-ed to Martha and Brian).

    Mikael's answer:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I checked the strange FITS-file and it seems that WAPP-4 has had a freak 
    incident. CRVAL1 is reported to be 250 MHz instead of 1385 MHz, UPPERSB is 
    said to be 0 instead of 1 and as a result of that, CDELT1 has got the 
    wrong sign. In the quick look this would show up as reversed spectrum 
    centered on 250 MHz.

    If you change those values, the data should be OK.

    How this happened is a good question.

    FITS file fixed by Phil on 11/02/2006.
