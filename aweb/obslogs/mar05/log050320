WAPP CRASH on file 10. File 10, beam 3 bad.


END LST:  ~13:50:00

Notes:
WAPP(2) ERROR counts don't match for chip 2 error again. 
Multiple tries to restart wapps and flush command did not work.  
Calls to M. Lerner and examiningn the last CAL of file 0010 
showed that beam 3 had died.  J. Hagen recommended call to 
B. Sisk.  W. Torres restarted all WAPP hardware.  
Further "Flush" commands, etc. gave same result, except 
now for all "chips".


Note added:  Bill Sisk replaced half a wapp, showed B. Kent how 
to run diagnostic and find a bad chip.  Replacement module was 
placed in the rack.  Testing completed in the afternoon - 
went fine.  See log050320ptest.
