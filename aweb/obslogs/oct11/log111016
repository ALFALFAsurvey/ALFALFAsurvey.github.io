At the bottom, add notes regarding:
-- Az=540
-- FAA radar ON
-- TOGS aborted. Lost some time when Az was moved to 580 instead of 540 
-- Beam 6B power level very low (range of 0.001-0.086), kept on
-- "Power Levels OK" means all but 6b.
-- During the second to last drift software was turned on by next observer. The software has an automatic safety feature which turned off the ALFA amps.
According to Operator, the next group got on early and switched the receivers.
--Looking at the CIMA logs, powerlevels spiked up to values 15-61
And also, copy the ALFA temperatures  and ALFA instrument status from the AO Operator's log
