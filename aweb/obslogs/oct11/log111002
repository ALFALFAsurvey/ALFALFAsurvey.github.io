At the bottom, add notes regarding:
-- TOGS run at beginning.
-- FAA radar (1350) off.
-- Beam 4A still dead. 
-- Adjusted power between fits 28 and 29 to try to fix beam 6b
-- Power levels in 6b remained flaky (very low) from fits 27 on


**** NOTE ADDED by Martha Oct 3
Thanks to the heads up by Lyle, I alerted Phil, Ganesh and Dana to the problem
with Beam 6 early in the morning, and heard back from them during the day:
Phil:
   I looked at the bm 6b data.
   It is bad in 6b and 7b (which is a copy of 6b  in the wapps).
   I also looked at the a2611 zoa data taken 3:00 am to 6:30 am on 03oct11 (after a2010).
   It also has problems with beam 6b. sometimes it is much lower than expected. Other times it is
   many times larger than 6a. (funny, i haven't yet heard a peep from a2611 about their data...).
   So the problem is not in the wapps. Dana, ganesh, and carlos are currently looking at the system upstairs.
Ganesh:
   The news is bad, I am afraid. There is clearly a problem with 6B 
   amplifier. This is unlike anything that we have seen before - not an open or short but intermittent 
   increase in current with accompanying drop in gain. Since the problem is in the 3rd stage, the 
   Tsys data taken this morning seemed OK.
   The plan is to leave 6B off for tonight and warm ALFA up a few tens of degrees tomorrow 
   morning, as Dana suspects the problem could be thermal in nature. We will observe what the warming 
   up and then cooling down does to the bias. Sometimes, thermal cycling restores proper operation.
   We are sorry to lose another channel for tonight (hopefully only for tonight...)
