Notes:
- Tiedowns are active
- We lost time at the start because we got the message "Correlator Configuration changed since last apply, continue?" after clicking "Observe".  
  We ignored the message but then saw no data was being taken.  
  We think the problem was clicking "Configure WAPP ALFA" too fast so that CIMA didn't register the command.  The command does not appear in the CIMA log file, even though
   we are sure we pressed the button.
- Documentation says the normal and test versions of CIMA marked 1.2.02 are the same, and Mikael says to use the normal version.

- BK notes:  When clicking to setup CIMA, make sure the command click are registered in the window before proceeding.  Otherwise the command may not take.
	     Willie Torres reported that our logout did not complete for some reason at the end.
