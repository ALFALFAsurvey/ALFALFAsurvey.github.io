Notes
-- Error in TOGS at beginning "Error failed pattern smart frequency
   switching"; appears associated with WAPPS. Could not abort and start
   again after restarting WAPPs.
   Exited CIMA and starting again. This is taking time....
-- At start, TOGS calibration eventually completed; startup of A2010 about 0130 AST.
-- strange occurrence in fits file 0018: scan number 535712468 starts at 03:28:44
   and lasts 600 sec. Next scan (a 1 sec cal) starts at 03:38:46, 602 sec later,
   which is right, but scan nr is 535713126, which indicates a start time 658 sec
   after previous scan, which is inconsistent with start time. Now, 13126 is
   03:38:46 after midnite (and similarly all the successive scans have numbers 
   that agree with the log AST start time), but all the previous scan numbers are
   inconsistent with the log's AST start time. 
   BIG QUESTION: are the data RA's and time stamps correct or are they affected by
   the same timing error? And why did this happen?
-- At end of CAL scan fits 0022, got error message: "exec evaluating message
   from WAPPDATA: ... WARN WAPPDATA flushing 12 dumps". We note that fits
   file 0022 is a bit short; perhaps the cal was not written; we will have
   to check this.
-- Sent a comment to CIMA using CIMA email comment. Got "`riccardo@astro.cornell.edu,
   haynes@astro.cornell.edu' does not look like a valid email address"
-- Running TOGS at end ok.
-- Monitoring power levels with alfaobswin throughout
