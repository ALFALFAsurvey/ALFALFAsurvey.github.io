Notes

1- "slew 0:01, status=not tracking" in the mid of the drift.
   Had to unwrap the telescope (az=0 instead of 360) :(
   Even after unwrapping we had tracking problems. Exit CIMA and asked the TO to try and make the tracking work. That fixed it.
   So we start taking data, and beam1, pol A has zero power. Restarted WAPPs, problem not solved...

   FITS 0035:  beam1, pol A has bad power levels; right after starting the observations we got a series of messages:
	02/21/05  2:33:33  WAPP(1) ERROR counts dont match for chip 4 
	02/21/05  2:33:33  WAPP(1) ERROR counts dont match for chip 5 
	02/21/05  2:33:33  WAPP(1) ERROR counts dont match for chip 6 
	...

   We were thinking of rebooting WAPP1, but tried to take data (while the TOs were trying to figure out how to do it) and magically
   WAPP1 started working again. Note that at the time when we were having problems with the WAPPs, Arun was working on them 
   (making disk space for next  experiment -- WAPP 4 was full). We learned this when he called in, after receiving a call 
   from the operator that we were having trouble with the WAPPs. Hypothesis: what he was doing caused our problems....

   Note also that, during the time WAPP1 was misbehaving, the ALFA Observation Monitor Window indicated that Beam 1A had no power;
   The ALFA instrument monitor window did not indicate any problem. Both pols of beams 0 and 1 are on WAPP1, so we don't understand
   why only 1A appeared dead in that one application. (The diagnostic tools don't always convey correct info...)
