NOTES:
--00:15 AST: Previous operator informs me (around 11:15 AST) that he saw sparks in the dome and
hence decided to "shut down" the telescope.
Operator has send notice to all concerned. Operator informs that most likely 
the system will be back up only in the morning, as  maintenance may not be 
able to find the problem until there is day light. Operator will notify me 
when/if we are ready at some point before our time runs out.  
--02:51 AST : Operator informs me that the sparks were created by the "480 Mega Watt" cable
brushing against some surface. This was found out by someone from maintenance.
He thinks it can be fixed during daytime and hence we should be able to observe tomorrow.
