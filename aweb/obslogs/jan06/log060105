END LST: 1034



Notes:
--TOGS failed at the beginning; not enough time to rerun.
-- CIMA froze, flushing water sound was heard, "time remining" was stuck at 1:03. CIMA is not responding; cannot ABORT or EXIT; cannot access (say, ls) on fits directory (/share/pserverf.sda2/). We had to exit the session on observer2; tried to restart CIMA but CIMA did not come up after asking for login and password. Called Mikael. CIMA log reports that CIMA had restarted, but except for the "Datataking" and "Executice" Windows, nothing came up. Mikael suggested that the problem could be associated with a disk that handles fits data, Arun is needed. Mikael cleared the processes om observer2, we were able to restart CIMA, and then resrated the WAPPS and tried to run the TOGS script as the observing session was nearing to end, but it got stuck at "WAPPCONFIG", and after few minutes CIMA reported that it failed to configure the WAPPS.
-- TOGS at end failed (see the point above).
