   Operator says things seem ok, but waterfall and monitoring also freeze. Furthermore
   observing seems to stop; at least, I cannot tell, so I stop/restart gracefully & quickly
   Power readjusted however, so it will be necessary to run 2 cal periods

LST stop:  1158

Picked up this night at last minute because of cancelled radar run.
During TOGS noticing: WAPP power levels are between 0.073 and 1.1.06 (still bad) messages
and sometimes" There are WAPP channels with too little power"
After starting first drift, decided to check power again, so restarted WAPPS,
manually adjusted power and started again. Problem still there. It seems to be
beam 5b. Lots of WAPP error warnings....

Then, at around 07:55, the CIMA timer froze. Nothing updated including aostatus running
on another workstation. I could not get a response to command prompts run on remoto
on my laptop. After 3-4 minutes it seemed to refresh, but I saw briefly a message
stating "stop encountered" in the CIMA window. Asked the operator if all ok; he indicated
it was. But waterfall plots are dark. At end of drift, program stops. I restart WAPPS
adjust power and restart. Have to terminate and restart alfadatawin twice to get correct
display.

Around 0508 AST the Puntas Salinas radar turned on at 1367 and 1382 MHz. Asked
T.O. to contact them by phone; at 0521: "I just talked to Martinez from
Puntas Salinas... everything should be back to normal in about 2 minutes".

A not-boring-enough night...
FAA radar active all night
Togs ran at start and end
