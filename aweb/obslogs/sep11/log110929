*****Zenith strip observing setup********
Be sure to note here the Az and ALFA rotation angles you specified at the start,
   along with the resultant ZA and Azimuth of the Gregorian Dome (AzG)
****
****   Az=243.0   ALFAang= -42.0  ZA=4.0  AzG=242.22  ZaG=4.02
****
Be sure to note here the actually RA at start and stop; this is not the same 
   as the LST when we are in off-meridian mode.
****
      RA@start=2315  RA@end=0320
      RA = LST + 15 min
****
During the night, please make occational notes of the ZA of the dome (ZAG). You may see
that it changes, due to the precession and pointing corrections. Remember the inner ZA limit
is 1.1 deg. If you are doing one of the strips within a few degrees of AO zenith,
you will notice that the ZA changes in a systematic fashion during the night. Any ideas
as to why that is?

NOTES:
We tried to run TOGS twice before our run and it failed both times because 
of WAPPS errors. The errors continued when we tried to run he drift. 
Re-starting CIMA did not seem to fix the problem. When we adjust the power
before observing, an error saying that the operation timed out while waiting
for the WAPPS to adjust power comes on and we are unable to take any observations.  
We had to wait until LST 2300 to start because of errors. FAA harmonic throughout. 

NOTE ADDED by Martha 9/30: Message from Luis Quintero
Dear Martha,
We had problems tonight with WAPP1, the half band filter connected to the 
correlator 1 was overloading the 48VDC line of one of the power supplies, 
producing a voltage drop of 18V (30VDC measured). This was disabling 
correlator 2, that is connected to the same power supply.
We isolated the problem disconnecting the mentioned half band filter, so I 
assume that you will have full bandwidth for this channel (I am not sure what 
is your configuration for A2010). The observer restarted the experiment, 
and checked the data files, reporting to us that everything looks fine.

Tomorrow morning we will check the failure, and we expect to have the 
equipment fully functional during the day. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Best,
-- Luis


-- Using 'zenith strip' observing mode
-- No TOGS (see notes above) 
-- Problems with WAPPS-WAPP 1 was dead when we started so Beam 0 and 1 were not working until LST 2300
-- FAA radar ON
-- Beam 4A dead. 
-- Tiedowns disabled 

(update below at end of night)
