At the bottom, add notes regarding:
-- TOGS run at start.
-- FAA radar ON.
-- Beam 4A is dead. The amplifier was on at the beginning of the run, but it was turned off 
early. We had some odd RFI that went away when beam 5A was turned off and 
reset. There were a few GPS bursts early in the night. WAPP writeout 
error: ERROR: BIG TIME LOGIC ERROR 
when we aborted the last file, but it said "WAPP successfully aborted" 
after.     

*** Note added by Martha 9/28
*** Phil and I have independently verified that there was no problem with RFI or with
    Beam 5A at the beginning of the night. However, Beam 5A was apparently turned off 
    at about record 541 of fitsfile 0021; it was turned back on in the first 10second of
    fitsfile22, and then turned off again for another short time at rec 435.
    It is speculated that the observers were having problems with the waterfall plot
    displays, perhaps because the autoscaling was including the bad beam, and may
    have mistaken the spikey bandpass for the dead beam 4A as RFI in beam 5A
    (given that quicklook labels the beams 1-7 not 0-6). 
    I have added a section to the "common rfi" page to warn about this.
