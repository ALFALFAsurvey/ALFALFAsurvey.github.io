At the bottom, add notes regarding:
--use AZ = 540 instead of 180 to avoid long slew at start
--Beam 6B dead entire night.
--FAA Radar ON
--TOGS at end only

-- Note added by Martha. Observers had trouble connecting via VNC to dataview.
   In consultation, we tried killing all a2010 VNC connections. MH noticed several
   .nfsXXXXXXXX files in .vnc at first. Tried logging out of dataview and restarting.
   No avail. MH notices that there are numerous VNC connections belonging to a2335
   left running on dataview, one of which calls "alfabeamwin". Jeff is able to get
   one VNC connection to fusion00, so we use that to connect to observer2 and run
   CIMA. alfaobswin run via ssh to dataview. Because of this, did not run 
   alfadatawin, but observer made regular checks of data with quicklook.
   In the morning, MH is able to start VNC on dataview with no problems. There are
   still some a2335 VNCs but the VNC connection number is back down to "2" (last night
   it was "14". Perhaps something got reset automatically. Will have StLU folks try again.
