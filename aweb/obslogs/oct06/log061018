Hi all

A2010 was cancelled yesterday due to problems with the AZ encoder. Ganesh,
Phil and others have been working until ~2am to fix it, and Robert first
and Tapasi later were able to observe after then. Tapasi told me that
there are two encoder readings for the AZ arm and that they are now
inconsistent (the problem started yesterday around 4pm). After trying to
troubleshoot the problem, Ganesh and the others chose a workaround in
order to allow people to observe for the rest of the night -- basically
they use one of the two readings and bypass the other one. But the problem
hasn't been fixed yet.

Hi all

Ok, so here is the story. Last Saturday lightning hit and damaged the
tie-downs. It was also realized that one of the two AZ encoders was
jumping. All the encoders (there are 4 in total) are connected to the same
board. It turned out that the encoders are ok, but the port to which the
"faulty" AZ encoder was connected is no longer working. So now the AZ
encoder used for the pointing is connected to a port that works. The
pointing was checked early this morning and is ok (maybe 1-2 arcsec worse,
says Phil). Bottom line: things should work fine now (but they still have
to fix the dead port). As for the data taken after Saturday, i.e. Sunday,
Monday, and Tuesday night, there might be pointing problems. Phil's guess
is up to 30 arcsec, but this is a guess. He needs to look into this (but
not right now... they are working on fixing the problems) and will post a
plot on his webpage. Notice however that Tapasi has been observing every
morning since the 10th and she did not notice pointing problems in these
last runs (the source was always there).
