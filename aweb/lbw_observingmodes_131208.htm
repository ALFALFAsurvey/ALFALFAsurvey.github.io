<h3><font color=#cc0f14>Current as of Dec 18, 2013</font></h3></center><br>

<li> Look here for the discussion of the setup used in <a href="lbw_observingmodes_2012.htm">Spring 2012</a></p>

As discussed in the ALFALFA followup <a href="ALFALFA_lbwobserving.htm">background</a> page, 
the spectrometer we use with LBW has more capability than we actually need for the followup
observations. So, we are going to try to make best use of it! We also don't want to have too
many different setups so that we don't waste time making too many changes, we can use the
same calibrations, and we can monitor the system performance and the behavior of RFI. </p>

In our first LBW observing runs, we used two distinct setups; you can read about them
<a href="lbw_observingmodes_2012.htm">here</a>. Starting in March 2012, we adopted a single 
setup for all LBW followup runs, regardless of the scientific aim of the program or the kind
of sources we target. 
We call this spectrometer setup the <b>"hybrid bandwidth, doppler tracking"</b>  mode.

<font color=#cc0f14><b>Hybrid bandwidth, doppler tracking mode</b></font>:</p>
    
This correlator setup yields four separate spectra,
in two pairs:
<ul>
<li> Two spectra, one for each of the two polarizations, of 2048 spectral channels covering a 25 MHz bandwidth,
     centered at the frequency corresponding to the heliocentric velocity specified in the observing catalog.
<li> Two spectra, one for each of the two polarizations, of 2048 spectral channels covering a 6.25 MHz bandwidth,
     centered at the frequency corresponding to the heliocentric velocity specified in the observing catalog.
</p></ul>
The first set of spectra are referred to as the "low resolution" spectra; the second are the "high resolution" ones.</p>

In terms of the correlator setup, we use 4 "boards", one for each of the four spectra.</p>
Boards 1 and 2 record spectra at 9 level sampling from the two
    polarizations separately. Each spectrum will cover 25 MHz with 2048 spectral pixels.
    Spectra will be centered at the frequency corresponding to the HI doppler shift,
    rounded to the nearest 100 km/s; this shifting will be done by reading the velocity
    from the input target catalog file.</p>

    Boards 3 and 4 are also samples at 9 levels and centered at the same velocity but 
    produce the higher resolution spectra by covering only 6.25 MHz also with 2048 channels.</p>
    We use the high resolution spectrum when the source emission is very narrow in velocity
    and gaussian; then the higher resolution can help us measure the width more accurately,
    if the signal-to-noise ratio is adequate.</p>
