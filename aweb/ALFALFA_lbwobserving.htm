</p><br>
In this document, we discuss how we set up the receiver (the "frontend"), 
the spectrometer (the "backend"), conduct observations and finally, produce a 
flattened (instrument/sky subtracted) spectrum for observations with the
ALFALFA followup observations made with the L-band Wide Receiver.</p>

<h3><font color="#cc0f14"> The L-Band Wide Receiver (LBW)</font></h3>

Because the objective of the followup observations is to obtain spectra
with lower noise than the main ALFALFA survey at specifically targeted
positions, we will use the more sensitive single-pixel 
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/~astro/RXstatus/Lwide/Lwide.shtml">L-band Wide
(LBW)</a>. Although the LBW receiver operates in the frequency range from 
1120-1730 MHz, we will insert a filter (called "1320-hipass") to limit it 
to 1280-1470 MHz
to cut down the impact of RFI on our observations.</p>

<br>
<h3><font color="#cc0f14"> The Spectral Bandpass</font></h3>
<table>
<tr><td>
The Spectral Bandpass refers the intensity of the total radiation collected
by the system over the frequency range covered by each spectrum. In general,
this intensity varies as a function of frequency in a complicated way.</p>

The image to the right shows a spectral bandpass for one of the ALFA beams;
for ALFALFA, the bandpass covers 100 MHz centered at 1385 MHz. </p>

Notice the frequency structure within the bandpass and the sharp followoff
at the high and low frequency edges; those are due to the bandpass filters and
we'll have the same issues when we go to the narrower bandwidths.</p>

When we already know the frequency of the candidate signal in the followup 
LBW observations, we can
use a narrower bandpass of say 25 MHz covering only the frequency of the
candidate so that we avoid known sources of RFI. In fact, we normally
adopt one of two observing modes which are discussed on a separate page
presenting the
<a href="lbw_observingmodes.htm">LBW Followup Spectrometer Setups</a>.

<h3><font color="#cc0f14"> Basic Total-Power Position-Switched (ON-OFF) Observations</font></h3>

Like most observations, measurements of the HI line emission from
galaxies require removal of the contribution to the noise from the instrumentation, the
sky and other sources other than the target. ALFALFA and its followup observations 
use different variations of the basic "position switching" technique to remove these 
other (more-or-less predictable, at least over short times) contributions to the power over
the bandpass.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>
The drift technique adopted by ALFALFA is designed to allow for adequate bandpass
subtraction using the drift scans themselves with no manipulation of the
data taking stream or electronics during a drift, e.g. with 
"minimum intrusion". We make use of the fact that most of the time, nearly all of
the bandpass contains no signal.
In ALFALFA, the bandpass subtraction is performed in the LOVEDATA
routine called <b>BPD</b>. A linear fit is calculated along the time dimension for
each frequency channel. The <i>rms</i> noise for each channel is calculated, and a record
is kept of what fraction of the time sequence deviates less that 2 times the <i>rms</i>. Outliers
are then excluded, and a final bandpass value for each frequency channel is taken 
as equal to the zeroth order coefficient of the linear fit. The adopted "OFF" bandpass
then is the normalized bandpass times the system temperature T<sub>sys</sub>. Removing the 
noise contribution in this way
works very effectively for sources that are not very large; it does not
work for very extended features such as galactic hydrogen. But, for nearly all
ALFALFA galaxies, this is quick and easy and quite acceptable. </p>

The purpose of the LBW observations is to increase the integration time ON-source,
so, rather than letting the sky drift across the beam, we actually track the
target. Therefore, in order to perform the bandpass/sky subtraction, we need an
equivalent OFF-source observation, i.e. one in which we expect the instrument+sky
noise at each channel to be identical to that contained in the ON-source spectrum.
Thus, we need to acquire an appropriate OFF-source bandpass that can be
subtracted for each ON-source observation; we end up then with matched
ON-OFF "pairs". This method is very common in radio
astronomy and is called "total power" or "ON-OFF" observing.</p>

Let's define a few terms:
<ul>
<li> T<sub>rx</sub>(f):  The receiver noise temperature at each frequency f
<li> T<sub>source</sub>(f): The source noise temperature at each frequency f (during the ON observation only)
<li> T<sub>conf</sub>(f):  The contribution to the noise from "confusion" (caused by lots of
weak unresolved sources) within the main beam during the OFF observation; 
this will normally be negligible and negligibly different from the general contribution
during the ON-source observation
<li> T<sub>sky</sub>(f):  The sky noise temperature at each frequency f, which includes
     the CMB contribution and the galactic background
<li> T<sub>spill</sub>(f):  The contribution to the noise temperature from other sources
such as ground pickup ("spillover", atmospheric noise, etc.)
<li> G<sub>rx</sub>(f): The receiver gain (from the all elements, including the backend, mixers, etc)
<li> G<sub>mainbeam</sub>(f): The telescope gain, i.e. the response to cosmic radiation
in the main telescope beam (from the aperture plane until the receiver)
</ul>

</p>

The signal then from the ON-source observation is</p> 
<center>
      ON(f) = G<sub>rx</sub>(f) * (T<sub>rx</sub>(f) + T<sub>source</sub>(f)*G<sub>mainbeam</sub>(f)
              + T<sub>sky</sub>(f)*G<sub>mainbeam</sub>(f) + T<sub>spill</sub>(f))
</center> </p>
Somewhere in the middle of all that noise, there will be our HI line source. It will not,
of course, be present in the OFF-source observation. 
Similarly, the signal from the OFF-source observation is</p> 
<center>
      OFF(f) = G<sub>rx</sub>(f) * (T<sub>rx</sub>(f)  + T<sub>conf</sub>(f)*G<sub>mainbeam</sub>(f)
              + T<sub>sky</sub>(f)*G<sub>mainbeam</sub>(f) + T<sub>spill</sub>(f))
</center>  </p>

The normal practice of tracking ON-OFF position switching is to
undertake the OFF-source observation immediately after the ON-source one and covering
the exact same track <i>on the sky</i> (e.g. in azimuth and zenith angle). In those circumstances, we
expect that T<sub>rx</sub>(f), T<sub>sky</sub>(f), T<sub>spill</sub>(f), G<sub>rx</sub>(f)
and G<sub>cos</sub>(f) will not change significantly between the two observations. 
Furthermore, under most conditions, T<sub>conf</sub>(f) will be negligible and negligibly
different from the general noise level during the ON-source observation
(except in the case of a strong continuum source; that's a complication for another
day...). Hence, the quantity we want,
i.e. the derived <b>total power difference spectrum</b>, is:
<center>
<img src="ONOFFeqn_crop.jpg" height=90>
</center>  </p>
Thus, our standard procedure will be to conduct paired ON-OFF observations for each
HI target. The first observations, the ON-source scan, will track the position of
the target for few minutes (nominally 3). The telescope will then move back to the
starting Az,ZA of the ON-scan and expose the OFF-source scan for the same length of time.
The track of each scan in the pair will cover the same Az,ZA (the same orientation with
in telescope coordinates). We will then construct the total power difference spectrum
from each pair as above.</p>

Following each pair of ON- and OFF-source observations, a set of calibration
scans will be taken with the built-in noise diode (the "cal") alternately
turned ON and OFF for 10 seconds each; these are the CalON and CalOFF scans.
It's a bit of a waste of time to fire the diode for so long, but there is no
option to make it shorter, as this is a standard part of the "standard ON-OFF"
CIMA mode.</p>

<b>Bottom line: Each target observation, including both the 3 minute ON-OFF target
pair and the calibration scans, will take about 8 minutes plus slew time.
A 5 minute ON-OFF pair with take about 13 minutes including slew time.</b></p>

<h3><font color="#cc0f14"> The Spectrometer (aka the "Backend")</font></h3>

For the main ALFALFA survey observations (program A2010), we use the WAPPs as the
backend. For the LBW observations, we used what is called the 
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/~astro/general_info/correlator/correlat.htm">
"Interim Correlator"</a>. BTW, it's been "interim" for more a decade....</p>

The correlator has lots of flexibility, actually more than we need, so as always,
we will try to "keep it simple". The basic parameters to control, 
set by the mysterious terms "sbc", "lags", and "subcorrelator" (="sbc") (not to
mention "interleaved", "Stokes" and "double Nyquist"),
are the total bandwidth per spectrum, the number of spectra (spectra of different
bandwidths could be take simultaneously if we wanted to, which we don't),
and the number of channels per spectrum. There is also a choice between
3-level and 9-level sampling; this describes the number of levels of encoding
of the signal autocorrelation function. The more the better for dynamic
range (e.g. in the presence of RFI) and precision. 
As the AO page says, <i>"9-level operation achieves 96.8% 
of the signal-to-noise of analog correlation, whereas 3-level achieves 81%."</i>
Under some circumstances, e.g. where spectral resolution is important, it is better
to sacrifice the 9-level, and doesn't make much difference. These subtleties
are left to those who take advanced radio astronomy....</p>

Like ALFA, LBW samples orthogonal polarizations which are essentially 
means that we record two independent spectra. So we will set up the 
correlator to treat the two polarizations independently.</p>

<!--
Another trick learned by young radio astronomers (c.f. <a 
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984AJ.....89..758H"> H&G 1984</a>, AJ 89, 758)
on the Arecibo staff in practically-prehistoric days (to many of you, at least) 
is to double-up the spectra analyzed
by the backend. Even though they are not wholly independent, recording this 
extra set of spectra (both pols) can recover some of the noise
introduced within the backend (amplifiers, mixers, etc). </p> -->

We fully understand that some of the very low signal-to-noise ratio
sources are spurious. Some of the high S/N ones may also be bogus,
especially because of RFI. Part of the objective of some of the LBW observing
programs specifically address the reliability of the different categories of 
low S/N sources (e.g. with and without possible optical counterparts, as
functions of S/N or width or flux density, etc). </p>

For a more specific discussion of the correlator setup we have been using
for the LBW ALFALFA followup observations, take a
look at the <a href="lbw_observingmodes.htm">ALFALFA followup LBW observing modes</a>
document.
</p>

<!-- Hence, we are going to set up the spectrometer
to use some of its extra (unnecessary for our needs for spectral resolution 
and frequency coverage) capability to monitor RFI within
the band and/or to look for signals at velocities different from the
source candidate.</P>

For the Jan 2012, we have decided on two <a href="lbw_observingmodes.htm"> observing modes</a>
one which we will use for the large number of very low velocity sources (cz < 2000 km/s)
and, a second, for sources at higher redshift (cz > 2000 km/s). See the discussion
<a href="lbw_observingmodes.htm"> here</a>.

<h3><font color="#cc0f14"> The Radiometer Equation</font></h3>

Take a look at the detailed discussion of <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/Radiometers.html">
radiometers</a> under the web site <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/ERA.shtml">Essential
Radio Astronomy</a> by Jim Condon and Scott Ransom at NRAO.</p>

For us, what we want to know is how the noise in the HI spectra depends on the integration time,
and the properties of the receiver/spectrometer setup. To derive the rms noise per spectral
element, &Delta;S<sub>rms</sub>, in Jy, the relevant parameters are:
<table>
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li> the system temperature (total noise contribution; see above), T<sub>sys</sub>, in K
<li> the system gain, G, in K/Jy
<li> the bandwidth per spectral pixel (i.e. spectrometer channel, or the final spectral resolution
     if we smooth), &beta;, in Hz
<li> the integration time, &tau;, in seconds
<li> C, an efficiency factor that depends on the correlator sampling level, of order 1, but
     about 0.8 for 3-level and more like 1.0 for 9-level.
</ul>
</td><td><img src="radioeqn.jpg" height=200>
</td></tr></table></p>
Note right away, that since the system temperature of LBW is lower than that of ALFA and
its gain higher, observations of the same integration time and spectral resolution made with LBW
will be more sensitive than those made with ALFALFA. And, with the LBW observations, we will
integrate 3 minutes ON-source. So we really are digging deeper into the noise (which is the
whole point!).</p>

Because we integrate for 3 minutes both ON- and OFF-source and also combine both polarizations,
the above equation doesn't exactly work. In ON-OFF position switching, the line is observed only
half of the time, but the noise is there all of the time. So, the equation, we actually use is
<img src="eqn_radiom_onoff.jpg" align=center height=80>
per polarization, or
<img src="eqn_radiom_2pol.jpg" align=center height=80>
when both polarizations are
averaged to obtain the final spectrum. Here, &tau; refers to the total
time (ON+OFF). You can read more about this at the Arecibo
