<h2><font color=#cc0f14> RFI alert for Sep 2011</font></h2>


Here is a second alert, sent out with short notice.
(And, an Air Force Lt. actually called Martha!!!! That is a first!)</p>

Fortunately, it seems that this extended L3 activity
will be from 17:30-19:30 AST and hence will terminate before A2010 starts.</p>

<pre>
We have received short notice from the US Space Command
(USSC), Colorado Springs, CO, informing the RA community of
upcoming, extended L3 test transmissions.  The observatories
should expect increased RFI @ 1381 MHz during the date &
times indicated below.  No specific cause was forwarded.

VLA & VLBA schedulers should attempt to schedule 1381 MHz use
around these times if possible.  Observing scientists should
be made aware of the increased possibility of corrupted data
on these dates and times.  VLA and VLBA operators should note
unusual L-band Tsys or total power fluctuations observed during
these times in the Operator Log forwarded to observers.
