<h3><font color=darkblue>Bad Beam Bogus Birdies: It's not really RFI.</font></h3>
<table width=800><tr><td width=500>
More often that we would like, one or more of the ALFA beams is dead. The power
to its amplifier should be turned off. But the way the data-taking schemes works,
an array of data is being recorded for the spectrum. Bogus data are bogus data,
with unpredictable results for autoscaling. Most of the quick-and-dirty data monitoring tools
("alfadatawin", "quicklook") assume all spectra are good and use autoscaling to
display. So, if you have bogus data, you may wind up with totally bogus autoscaling</p>

The image to the right shows an example of the "corplot" display (same as
"quicklook") which you get if you use the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/checkfitsnotes.txt">
IDL recipe</a> (or "quicklook" which looks at Record 0 only) to look at a particular
record. In this example, Beam 4A is dead: <b> Note that the beams here are displayed with 
labels 1 to 7 not 0 to 6,</b> so the dead beam is the red line with spikes in the Beam
mis-labeled "5". This is <b>not RFI</b>; notice also the difference in the vertical
scale of the plot for this beam relative to the others.</p>
</ul>
</p>
Know what this is and then ignore it. Be sure to switch the display in the waterfalls plots
to ignore the bad amplifier; in this case, set it to display Beam "B", not "A" or "both".
Also, if you can't seem to get the waterfall plots to display correctly, switch the
"alfadatawin" display to view the "spectral plots" and set the y-scale to "constant".
Take a look also at the power level monitors in "alfaobswin". If the power is steady,
then there is no RFI -- you are just seeing the bogus data from the dead beam.

<h3><font color=darkblue>The San Juan FAA radar</font></h3>
<table width=800><tr><td width=500>
As noted on Phil's <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~phil/rfi/rfilist.html">
list</a>, one of the frequencies (1350 MHz) used by the San Juan airport FAA 
radar lies within the ALFALFA bandpass, so it almost always shows up. It is
pulsed, polarized, azimuth-dependent and not picked up equally by all beams.
When it is strong, harmonics may show up at 1380 and (sometimes) 1410 MHz.</p>

The image to the right shows an example of the main
transmitter plus the (much weaker but still visible) 1380 MHz harmonic.</p>

There is not much we can do about the radar; it's needed
and entirely legal. Please record at the bottom
of the log file whether the FAA radar is on (or off!).</p>

<h3><font color=darkblue>The Puntas Salinas radar</font></h3>
<table width=800><tr><td width=500>
As noted on Phil's <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~phil/rfi/rfilist.html">
list</a>, the Puerto Rico Air National Guard station at Puntas Salinas
has a landing system which operates at 1367 and 1382 MHz. It is not
supposed to be turned on when we are observing (i.e. its use is not supposed
to interfere with observations at AO). See also
<a href='http://www.naic.edu/~rfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html'> this link</a>. 
</p>

The image to the right shows an example of the Puntas Salinas transmissions
(also visible are the FAA 1350
transmitter plus the 1380 MHz harmonic, discussed above).</p>

If you see the dual frequency signature of Puntas Salinas, ask
the telescope operator to call the folks at the air station to tell them to 
turn off their equipment. Be insistent, if necessary; call yourself even.
Also, if it persists, file an rfi report by emailing 
"rfi-grp_AT_naic.edu". Include in the message the 
AST time, frequency, description of the RFI, and
please cc Martha (haynes_astro.cornell). Also, of course,
include a note in the observing log file.</p>

<h3><font color=darkblue>The Global Positioning Satellite Nuclear Event Detector</font></h3>

<table width=800><tr><td width=500>
On occasion, you may see one or more short bursts of rfi, lasting from 30 to 180
seconds, centered at 1381 MHz and extending over 1-2 MHz. These bursts arise from the
NUclear DETonation detection (NUDET) system aboard the Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellites. This system was established in the late 1970's as the US was planning
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty giving up the right to conduct tests of nuclear
weapons. The NUDET system was designed to allow the US to verify that other nations
are in compliance with the treaty. See this 
<a href="http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/nssrm/initiatives/usnds.htm">
link</a>.</p>

The image to the right shows an example of a GPS/NUDET burst (along with the FAA radar
at 1350 and the mysterious new 1375 MHz birdie whose identity is not yet known.)
Notice that GPS/NUDET is polarized and not identical in all beams.
If you are curious, Phil has a set of <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~phil/satdoc.html">
IDL routines</a> which predict the passage of satellites over AO.</p>

Click <a href="images/d2028_rec300_gps.gif">here</a> to enlarge. You
might want to compare that with this normal display
<a href="images/d2138_rec300_nogps.gif">without GPS</a>
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
If you notice up to a few, short (<300 sec) GPS/NUDET bursts, make a note(s) 
in the log file.</p>

The use of the 1381 MHz frequency for GPS/NUDET was carefully negotiated
back in the 1980's to minimize impact on radio astronomy while still insuring
national security (No kidding: this discussion including folks whose
offices were in the White House...!).  As a result, there
are limits to the burst duration and total accumulated time per day, month
etc that the NUDET system can transmit for system tests under "normal" circumstances. 
Once in a while, the Air Force notifies the observatory of 
planned systems tests which may exceed the normal limits; we post received 
NUDET test <a href="rfi_alerts.htm">notifications</a>. If you are observing
when there is not a posted alert and the duration of the GPS/NUDET seems excessive,
file an rfi report by emailing "rfi-grp_AT_naic.edu". Include in the message the 
AST time, frequency, description of the RFI, and
please cc Martha (haynes_astro.cornell).</p>

Fortunately, GPS/NUDET bursts results from system tests and
do not mean that an above-ground nuclear event has taken place so you
don't need to dive under a desk. (That is a joke to us old folks.)</p>
