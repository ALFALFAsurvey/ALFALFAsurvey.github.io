<h3> IMPORTANT NOTES FOR <font color=#cc0f14>Feb-Mar 2011</font> </h3>
<ul>
     <li><font color=#cc0f14> Note:</font> FULL ZENITH ANGLE MOTION IS NOW ALLOWED!</font> However,
                if you need to slew the telescope a long way (unwrap), have the operator perform
                the azimuth slew with the <b>ZA = 15 degrees</b>, and then move to higher ZA.</p>
     <li><font color=#cc0f14> Note:</font>  Beam 6b is dead. Therefore, its power will display as low (you may see some spikes in the spectrum
          for 6b; just ignore them!). You will also see error messages:<br>
          <ul><li><font color=#cc0f14><i> "check_wapp_levels: WAPP power levels are between 0.103 and 1.126 (still bad)"</i></font><br>
         As long as the power levels look ok in the other ampliers, all should be ok.</ul>
     <li><font color=#cc0f14> Note:</font> 
     Warnings about WAPP chip count errors appear in the cimalog file (but not in the CIMA log window). Examples
     are:
         <ul>
         <li><font color=#cc0f14><i>"WAPP=4-chip_count: Counts don't match between chip 0 and chip 4 (99999964 != 99999966  diff = 2)!"</i></font>
         <li><i>"WAPPDATA-search_agc: Interpolating agc-data over 2.00 second time gap (65545.0 - 65547.0)!"</i>
         <li><i>"WARNING WAPPDATA-search_pnt: WARNING extrapolating pnt-data from 55592.243889 to 55592.243900!"</i>     
     As long as the "diff" is small or the interpolation is over only a few secs or the extrapolation is likewise small, there is
     no real problem. Just check the data, both in the waterfall plots and using "quicklook".</ul>
    <li> While these CIMA warnings are not fatal, they make the cimalog files large (Mbytes). If size of the cimalog file exceeds the 
    limit of the
    web service, you may not be able to view it. Be sure to include the link in the loglinks file anyway. And, of course, keep an
    eye on the WAPPS for more serious **error** messages.
     <li><font color=#00cc66>Note: &nbsp Sept 12, 2010:</font> &nbsp &nbsp
    The TOGS calibration script sometimes hangs at the stage of rotating ALFA into position and times out
    (after 2 min).
    Run it again, and it should work. The problem has been reported.
    <font color=#00cc66> We have not seen this for a while, so we hope the problem has been fixed.</font>
     <li> You need to start CIMA by typing <b>"cima --X"</b>. (Notice the "--X".)
     <li> <b>"Help"</b> info is available by right clicking on any widget or parameter
     <li> The sources in your catalog which are "visible" are indicated along with
              their current location, slew time, etc. 
     <li> It is possible to launch the system monitoring widgets from within CIMA.
     <li> <b>"Accept"</b>  is the same as <b>"Apply"+"Dismiss"</b> 
     <li> The <b>scan number convention</b> is "ydddNNNNN.fits" where
          <b>"y"</b> is the year number, <b>"ddd"</b> is the day number within the
             year and <b>"NNNNN"</b>  is a sequential number. <p>

     <li><font color=#cc0f14> If you are practicing with CIMA:</font>
         <ol><li> Use the machine called "fusion00" (or one of the other aolcN machines); Do <b>NOT</b> use 
                  "dataview" and do <b>NOT</b> log into "observer2". 
             <li> Be sure that your VNC sessions are really killed on "fusion00" after you are done.
             <li> Do <b>NOT</b> run the data monitoring programs "alfadatawin", "alfaobswin" etc. 
            Remember that we aren't the only ones who use these machines and that the observer has priority
            on dataview and observer2 and to the data monitoring.</p></ol>

    <li> During <font color=#cc0f14>Spring sky runs in 2011</font>, run <font color=#cc0f14>TOGS <b>only at the end</b></font>
         of the observing block (and only if time is allocated for it). Use the file <b>command_galfacurpos_spr2011.cmd</b>.<br>
     <b>Note:</b> TOGS is allocated 15 minutes after the nominal end of A2010, but the
        TOGS script "galafacurpos" takes only about 6 minutes to run, and there is no telescope movement
        ("curpos" stands for "current position"). Therefore, you can run the last
        A2010 10-minute drift scan over the nominal end of the time allocation for A2010 itself by as much as 8 minutes
        (depending on how fast you are; Martha made it 8 minutes over, ran TOGS and still exited CIMA with 50 seconds
         to spare...). But, you do need to exit CIMA before the end of the TOGS allocation!

<hr>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14">Startup:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> Ask the telescope operator to move to the azimuth and approximate zenith angle of the drift you're
    doing. <b>In spring2011</b>, we will be observing north of zenith (Decl &gt; +19d) so use <b>AZ = 180 (or 540)</b>. 
    But... <b>be sure the operator
    gives you back telescope control!</b>  Alternatively, go to the "Pointing Control" window
    and point the telescope to the first position; just be sure the telescope goes to the proper azimuth.  
    Usually the best approach is to have the telescope operator send the telescope to the approx
    AZ, ZA <b> before (tell him/her)</b> he/she starts
    up GALSPECT. <b> <i> If so, don't start CIMA until the telescope is close to position (once you start
    CIMA, the telescope motion will halt until you start the TOGS command file.) </i></b>

</p>

<li><b> Note:</b>  During <font color=#cc0f14><b>spring 2011 runs</b></font>, we normally run <font color=#cc0f14><b> TOGS only at 
   the end</b></font>, so you can skip this step and go to <font color="darkorange"><b> Load configuration</b> </font> 
   below.
   <br>
  <b>Check the TOGS setting</b>: &nbsp &nbsp 
   The TOGS calibration script contained in <b>command_galfasrc_meridian.cmd</b> sends the
   telescope to the position specified for <b>``galfasrc''</b> in the <b>a2010.cat</b> file
   and then tracks that position for 5-6 minutes. Be sure that <b>galfasrc</b> has the
   right R.A. and DecJ (the Dec should be the same as that for the A2010 drift for the session; the
   R.A. should correspond to the current LST).
</p>

<li><i><font color="#008000">LET THE OPERATOR DO THIS STEP!</font> 
On the dataview machine do the following to start GALSPECT:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Login to dataview using the a2010 account.  Switch to the 
       guest account via <b>ssh -l guest dataview</b>.  You must do this as guest.</i>
<li><i>In the same xterm window ssh to the galfa1 machines.  <b>ssh -i galfa_key galfa@galfa1</b>.  You should see a '#' prompt. </i>
<li><i> Check if ghost galspect processes are running by typing <b>ps</b>. 
If processes called <b>gdiag</b> are present, kill them by typing the command <b>kill</b> followed by the process number.</i>
<li><i>Warm up GALSPECT via typing <b>/var/diag</b></i>
<li><i>Type the command:  <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  If you get the message 
    LO2:  Set failed, got back:  ERROR setting freq, 
then you need to start the gpib on the wapp server.  
To do this, start CIMA and click <b>Restart GPIB</b> under the
Utilities menu. Go back to the 
xterm logged into galfa1 and again type <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  You should not receive an error.
</i>
<li><i>Enter the command <b>/var/togs</b>.  This will run for the rest of the night, so minimize the windows</i>.<br>

<font color="#cc0f14"><b>Note: if the operator is not able to get GALSPECT to run, he/she should call the
<a target="_blank" href="http://sites.google.com/site/galfahi/contact-folks">TOGS contact</a> for
the night.</b></font></p></ul>

<li> <b> Log into  OBSERVER2: dtusr </b>  (once the previous observer is out). Password is taped to
computer.</p>

<a target="_blank" name="cima"></a>
<li> <b>Start CIMA on-line GUI </b>when telescope is close to start position. At the moment, you need
    to type <b>cima --X</b> in an available window or right click on the screen background and choose <b>CIMA Online GUI</b>.
   Select the desired version of
    CIMA; this is currently "The 'smart' version of CIMA (3.1.08 2010-02-01 17:44 "Smart")".

<ul> 
    <li>Project Number: <b>a2010</b>

   <br>
<b> Command File Observing  (TOGS) Menu</b>
 <ul> 
   <li>Click <b>Load</b> - to open a menu listing available command files.
   <li>Select the file <b>'command_galfasrc_meridian.cmd' </b> (scroll down) and then <b> click Accept.</b>
   <li>  When the operator has given the OK that TOGS is running, check and, if necesary,
adjust the RA, Dec for <b>galfasrc</b> in the <b>"a2010.cat"</b> file. 
   <li> Click <b> Run</b> to run the command file. The telescope will slew to requested position and, 
when it reaches the meridian, TOGS calibration will run for ~7 minutes.  
   <li>As
soon as "observing menu" appears it can be used to verify settings and
then closed. The "command file" window cannot be closed until the run
file is finished, at which point click <b> Close </b>.
and then continue with <b> Load Configuration</b> menu (below) <br> 
  <li> For for any reason the command file hangs, restart it; make sure that you 
restart from First line by clicking appropriate button at middle left on Command Log GUI.

  <li> <font color="#cc0f14"><i>Note: if the GALSPECT spectrometer is not set up within 
ten minutes of their allotted time (so that
the ~7 mins of calibration cannot be run before A2010 is scheduled to start), do not run the TOGS

For meridian observing, the configuration file should set all the basic parameters; you'll just
need to change the start position from "galfasrc" to the drift you want.
<ul>
   <li> Check that the <b>azimuth position</b> is set to the exact value (180 for Spring 2011) for this observation.
             Notice the possible configuration of Az+360 (=540. for az=180)
              according to wrap. We think that the telescope will chose the closer one, but 
              double check if the telescope seems to be unwrapping itself. 
              Be sure to record the one that is actually used.
   <li> Check that the <b>ALFA rot angle</b> is set to the exact value (19 for Spring 2011) for this observation. 
   <li> Quickly check the basic setup for fixed azimuth observing. Correct values:
	<ul>
        <li>  The<b> observing mode</b> is <font color="#cc0f14">Fixed azimuth drift map</font>

<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> When Observing:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> As soon as you start observe, run some immediate quick checks. Always check that 
     the <b>RA, DecJ, Az,</b> and <b>ALFA rotation angle</b> are correct.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Check that the telescope is actually at the correct declination </b><br>
           1. Check the declination displayed in the <b>CIMA observation status window</b> <br>
           2: Check the "Rslt" line in the <b>monpnt</b> window (the upper right window on the screen
            below the frequency band monitor). Dec value should stay within a few
            arcseconds of the drift value. 
    <li><b>Check that the ALFA rotation angle is properly set</b>. Click on <b>telescope</b> in the <b>
           CIMA observation status window</b> and check the number to the right of "ALFA" in the bottom right hand corner
           of the display.
    <li> Check the power levels and waterfall plots as usual.
    </p>
    </ul>
<li>
<a target="_blank" name="log"></a>
<b>Keep a log file </b>. You can find a sample <a href="log_template">here</a>; find this in 
<b>/share/obs4/usr/a2010/log/template</b>. And also check out recent log files to see what has
been happening recently, what RFI has been noticed, what beams have been misbehaving. 
<b>Remember:</b> It is <b>very</b> important to keep an accurate log of what 
happens, even to note "an uneventful night".  To do so:
<ul>
  <li> ssh to another machine as <i>a2010</i>

  <li> open a new file <b>logYYMMDD</b> in <b>/share/obs4/usr/a2010</b>
using you favorite
text editor (vi or pico work well when remote observing; emacs may be too
slow, unless you use the '-nw' flag to open in a terminal). Use a
posted log file or <a href="log_template">this one</a> as a template. 
<li> record **anything** of note, especially 
<br>(1) the CIMA version number and the saved state (In Spring 2011, this is: a2010_az180_2011.conf) 
    <br>(2) any bad files, 
    <br>(3) any power adjustments, 
    <br> (4) unusual rfi etc. (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting list</a> to check 
for notes about specific RFI frequencies.)

<br>To quote Brian: <i> I cannot stress the importance of keeping accurate logs.  
While the file conversion software works automatically, it is good to have a backup to check against when 
comparing scan numbers.  Sometimes CIMA squeezes in extra scans at the beginning or end of the run, or 
has some other unpredictable behavior.  It is also important to note "empty" files, as IDL will hiccup on these.</i>
Martha adds: <i> I read the log files every morning and that's the only way I can uncover problems quickly. We also
use the logs when the data are flagged: to be warned of issues with calibration, RFI sources, standing waves,
continuum sources and receiver instabilities. We don't know what happened; but you do -- so tell us via the log file.
The folks who calibrate/process the drifts you take will thank you for your carefully note-taking (and will be entirely
justified in saying unkind things about you otherwise).</i>
</ul>
</p>

<li><b>Be vigilant for new sources of RFI; carefully check the waterfall plots and/or quicklook.</b>
Know the expected locations in the band of the "usual suspects". The
FAA radar  is usually at 1350 MHz (although they sometimes use 1330 MHz, out of our bandpass!).
Strong RFI at 1367 and 1382 MHz is due to the
Punta Salinas naval base radar, which should <b>not</b> be on during ALFALFA run 
(see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Erfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html"> this link</a>.) . 
If you see this, ask the operator to 
call Punta Salinas immediately and tell them to turn off their equipment! 
See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> 

observational troubleshooting list</a> for other observing issues.)

</li>

</p>
<li><b>Between loops:</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Check power levels periodically. </b>They should stay in the range (0.8,1.2) and be coded 
        <font dark="" blue=""> blue </font> on the dataview observer's monitor. Note any odd power level
         variations in log. (Remote observers: be sure to note in log that you checked periodically.) 
        <b>Do not adjust the power levels during a run unless absolutely necessary; be sure to make a 
           clear note in the log file if you do so; it is necessary to process separately drifts done 
           before and after the adjustment,
           so make sure the processer can tell from the log file how to group the drift files.</b>

    <li>Keep track of the times, file numbers, scan numbers for drift and cal and any notes in the log file. 
    <li>Keep an eye on the declination on the monpnt window on
           the right hand console to make sure it is the same (within
           a few arcsec) of the desired J2000 declination.
    </ul> </p>

<li><b>File Integrity: Check the FITS files to make sure the coordinates are being written correctly.</b>  
     Use the IDL program <b> quicklook. </b> 
     <ul>
       <li> <b> ssh </b> to one of the fast linux machines, like "fusion01", "aolc1", "aolc2" etc.
       <li> &gt cd /share/a2010/idl/eggidl. 
       <li> IDL&gt @wasinit2 
       <li> IDL&gt;  quicklook, '<i>filename</i>'
    <br> where 'filename' is the name of the fits file, with directory path. The directory path can
      be found in the log file, e.g., /share/wappdata/wapp.20061116.a2010.0011.fits
     </ul>
<br>     This is fast and is good to use while remote observing.
         If you want to look at an arbitrary record, see the file "checkfitsnotes.txt" in
         the /share/obs4/usr/a2010 directory.</p>


<li><b><b>Data Monitoring:</b>
    </b><ul>    <li>Use the widgets provided on the dataview computer or within the CIMA widgets (there are
    lots of monitoring tools; learn to use them!). When you
    are in the control room, you can start them from the pull-down menu on
    the dataview machine; be sure that the "CIMA version" is set to what
    you want. Alternatively, you can open the widgets by typing the
    following commands on an xterm: <ul>
      <li><b>alfamonwin</b> &amp; - same display as to the right of the operator's station
      <li><b>alfamotorwin</b> &amp;- shows ALFA rotation angle - good to check at start
      <li><b>alfabeamwin</b> &amp;- shows approximate positions of each beam; 
    can set to RA,Dec (note: currently, the positions aren't quite perfect but still helpful.)
      <li><b>alfaobswin</b> &amp;- smaller window showing the power in dB for each beam
      <li><b>alfadatawin</b>

&amp;- waterfall plots in your color of choice (select ALFA pattern,
then waterfalls from the pull-down menu under diagrams). Too cool.
Enough said. </ul> The latter two (alfadatawin and alfaobswin) are
particularly useful in monitoring the data and should be left up in
plain sight.<br>

    <li>Notice that you will not be able to start <b>alfadatawin</b> if the process is already 
    running on dataview (started by one of the previous observers). If this happens, ask the telescope 
    operator to kill the previous process or, if he cannot, to contact Mikael, Arun, or Phil to do so.
    </ul> </p>

<li><b><b>If there is a power failure...</b>
   There is a remote "reset" switch for ALFA - it is no longer necessary to go up to the dome and push the reset button.

</ul>

<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> If the WAPPs get confused...which WILL happen:</font></h2><font color="#cc0f14"> </font>
    The only sign of this happening in CIMA is that messages appear in <font color="red">red</font> in the
    CIMA log window. WAPP error messages include: <font color="red"><i>WAPPs confused</i></font> 
indicates a hardware problem (Note the messages <font color="darkorange"><i>WAPP (3) WARNING - 
Counts don't match for chip 1</i></font> and <font color="darkorange"><i>WAPPDATA-queue_agcdata: 
WARNING received duplicate AGC-datablock</i></font> are not WAPP errors.)
 Occasionally there is no warning message from CIMA, but the countdown
    time on the aostatus window stops, meaning that the WAPPs are no longer taking data.
    Sometimes the problems go away, so try to restart
    the WAPPs and then the observing again.
    <ul>

    <li>Procedure: 
          <ul>
    <li><b>Abort</b> Observation in, e.g.,  the <font color="darkorange">observing menu</font>
        <li><b>Restart the WAPPS </b>under <font color="darkorange"> Utilities </font>
        <li>Repeat start up process
          <ul> <li> <b>Load Configuration</b> as before. <b> Load and Apply </b>
               <li> <b> Reconfigure the WAPPS: </b> Click on B <font
          <font color="darkorange"> Backend Control Menu, </font> which opens the Configure Wapp ALFA
                  window. Check that all WAPPs are using 2 channels
                  and 3 levels and at 100MHz. <b> Accept </b> this configuration.
               <li> In the CIMA observing menu, select drift again and adjust
                    starting time.
               <li> Adjust power and observe.
          </ul>
         </ul>

 If this does not work, try again, up to a few times. If this still does not help,
      exit CIMA and start again.
  If the <font color="red">error messages keep appearing</font>,  it will be necessary to have the operator call an engineer to
    look into the problem. Currently, the WAPP experts are Giacomo Comes and Arun.</p>
   </ul>

<a target="_blank" name="finish"></a>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> Finishing Up:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>After a few seconds of integration time, <b> abort</b> the last unfinished scan.  

<li> <b> If running TOGS: </b>  (as is the <b><font color=#cc0f14> normal plan in Spring 2011!) </font></b>
<ul> <li> Under <b>Utilities</b>, <b>Restart the WAPPs</b> (note
any error messages when you do this; if you get any, try restarting the WAPPs again)
<li> Go to <b>Command File Observing</b>, and click on <b> Load </b>.  
Choose <b>'command_galfacurpos_spr2011.cmd"</b>, click <b> accept </b>,  and 
<b>run</b> the script.  TOGS calibration will take about 6 minutes, so be sure to allow for this before the next program
is set to start. But also note that you can run a few minutes over the nominal end of A2010 to finish a drift since 
if you are quick about things, TOGS does not need the full 15 minutes allocated to it; use your judgement! The main point
is that you need to finish TOGS and log out before the start of the NEXT program. <i>Note: should the telescope run into the ZA limit during TOGS calibration, just let it finish 
(or abort and give up). </i>.</p>

</ul>
<li>Exit CIMA normally
<li>Exit the observer2 machine
<li>Exit data monitoring programs "nicely"
<li>Exit IDL (if you were using it)
<li>CTRL-C out of the GALSPECT control and logout of galfa1 (Let the operator do this!)
<li>Exit out of the dataview machine</p>

<li><font color=#cc0f14><b>If you are observing remotely using VNC:</b></font>
    &nbsp be sure to
    follow the instructions for terminating VNC connections cleanly in the
