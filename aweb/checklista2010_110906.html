<h3> IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR <font color=#cc0f14>SEPTEMBER</font> 2011</h3>
<b> We are trying to complete the zenith strip drifts which means that we will be observe off-meridian
    for much of September. Fortunately,
    since the ZA is no longer restricted, this is easier than it was last year. But please read and understand the
    A2010 instructions for <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~a2010/zenithstrip_instr.html">
    zenith strip observing</a> to understand the limitations and our approach to them.</b></p>
    <b><font color=#00CC66>Warning from Sept 2010: &nbsp (we do not know in 2011 if this is still an issue) </font></b>&nbsp &nbsp
    Warnings about WAPP chip count errors appear in the cimalog file (but not in the CIMA log window).
    This warnings do not appear to be fatal, but the size of the cimalog file therefore exceeds the limit of the
    web service. Include it in the loglinks.htm file, but you won't be able to view it. And, of course, keep an
    eye on the WAPPS: this is not a positive sign.</p>
    <b><font color=#00CC66>Warning from Sept 2010: &nbsp (we do not know in 2011 if this is still an issue)</font></b>&nbsp &nbsp
    The TOGS calibration script appears to hang at the stage of rotating ALFA into position and times out
    (after 2 min).
    Run it again, and it should work. The problem was reported last year. </p>

<ul>
<li> We are using several special configuration files "*.conf", both for a2010 and the
     TOGS calibration. They all have <b>"11"</b> in their names.
<li> Starting Sep 9, 2010, we will be observing north (or at zenith; except to complete one lone drift
     in the south, missed previously), and in most cases in September, in "zenith strip" mode. You need
     to check the schedule to know what azimuth (and what configuration file) to choose.
     &nbsp &nbsp <font color=#cc0f14>NEW!!</font>
<li> In Fall 2011, TOGS runs <b> at the start</b> of A2010 <b>ONLY</b>. Time is not allocated to run
     TOGS at the end of the night, so don't run it at the end unless there is extra time (a gap before
     the next program). Furthermore, TOGS now points to a position specified in (Az,ZA) that is set by
     the TOGS team. As long as they do their homework, you should not have to edit any files for them.
<li> For zenith strip observing, we
     use a new set of basic configuration files called <b>a2010_az85_2011.conf</b>
     (for observations near but not at 90 degrees) and <b>a2010_az265_2011.conf</b>
     (for observations near but not at 270 degrees). These only get you <b>close to what you need</b>;
     you have to make further adjustments <b>by hand</b>
     because the azimuth and ALFA rotation angle change each day. <i> Note: When we return to meridian
     observing, we use the standard files <b>a2010_az180_2011.conf</b> or <b>a2010_az360_2011.conf</b>;
     in that case, the configuration file will set the ALFA rotation angle to the correct value (+19.0 degrees
     on the meridian).</i>
<li> For zenith strip observing, you may need to adopt <b>Az+360</b> rather than the Az listed in the schedule; we
     think that the telescope control system is smart enough to pick the nearest one, but we suggest that you
     note where the previous observer has  left the telescope, think about options,and then make the right 
     choice (Az or Az+360) yourself. Be sure to record the one actually used by the telescope control software.
<li> For the zenith strip, the hour angle is non-zero, i.e. the right ascension and 
     LST ranges <b>do not</b> coincide; they are offset by 20-30 minutes, earlier or later, 
     depending on whether we are observing south of, or north of, zenith. Check the schedule.
<li> For the zenith strip, the configuration file doesn't set everything for you and you need to make adjustments
     by hand after it is loaded. After the telescope gets to the approximate position,
     you need to (1) <font color=#cc0f14><b>rotate ALFA</b></font> using the <b> pointing control</b> widget, 
    (2) <font color=#cc0f14>set the <b> azimuth</b>,
     the <b> ALFA rotation angle</b> and the <b> starting R.A.</b></font> in the <b> spectral line observing</b>
     widget.
<li> For the zenith strip observing, you may notice that the Z.A. changes systematically during 
     the night. Remember that we are tracking in J2000 coords
     and it is now 2011.7. Close to 90,270 a small change in Decl translates to a larger change in Z.A.
     Refer to the  ALFALFA notes on <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/ugrad/precession.php">precession</a>.
     As long as we are within the limits of 3.5 < Z.A. < 12 degrees, we are ok.
<li> Check that the ALFA rotation angle looks ok using <b>alfabeamwin</b> but remember that the coordinates
     displayed in this widget may not be exactly correct. In fact, close to 90 or 270, the optimal rotation angle will
     vary by a lot; we have chosen a single "best value" (it is not clear we can determine it more accurately, anyway).
     As long as the arrangement looks reasonable for our desired
     <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/ugrad/observingmode.htm">mode</a>, then we should be ok.
<li> We position the telescope at a particular Az and DecJ2000. The resultant Az and ZA won't 
     exactly match (because of the pointing, precession and the hour angle). The hour angle is determined
     by when you actually start taking data; our
     setup assumes a value which may not be exact. Just be sure that the DecJ2000 is correct by
     checking that the "Rslt" declination in the <b>monpnt</b> display is the correct DecJ2000. 
     It will be updated
     every ten minutes (beginning of each drift), so it may stray a bit, and it may require a few seconds to move into
     position. Remember that that the beam is ~3.5 arcmin and it takes ~14 sec of time for a source to drift through the
     beam so if you are "off source" for a few seconds at the start of the next drift, it doesn't really matter....
<li> Please record extra information (az, ALFAang, start/stop RA) at the top of the log file; see a recent log file that
     also used the off-meridian/zenith strip observing mode.
<li> You need to start CIMA by typing <b>"cima --X"</b>. (Notice the "--X".)
<li> <b>"Help"</b> info is available by right clicking on any widget or parameter
     <li> The sources in your catalog which are "visible" are indicated along with
              their current location, slew time, etc. 
     <li> It is possible to launch the system monitoring widgets from within CIMA.
     <li> <b>"Accept"</b>  is the same as <b>"Apply"+"Dismiss"</b> 
     <li> The <b>scan number convention</b> is "ydddNNNNN.fits" where
          <b>"y"</b> is the year number, <b>"ddd"</b> is the day number within the
             year and <b>"NNNNN"</b>  is a sequential number which now has nothing to do
             with the time. Note also it has nothing to do with the FITS file number. <p>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14">Startup:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> Ask the telescope operator to move to the azimuth and approximate zenith angle of the drift you're
    doing. For the <b>zenith strip</b>, 
    this could either be near 85 degrees (not 90!) or near 265 degrees (not 270!) depending
    on whether the drift tracks south of zenith (Decl &lt; +18.4d; use AZ near 85) or north of zenith
    (Decl &gt; +18.4d; use AZ near 265). Or, for <b>meridian observing</b>, it can either be 360 degrees 
    (NOT 0) or 180 degrees (540 equivalent) depending
    on whether the drift tracks north of zenith (Decl &gt; +20d; use AZ =&gt; 180) or south of zenith
    (Decl &lt; +16d; use AZ = 360). But... <b>be sure the operator
    gives you back telescope control!</b>  Alternatively, go to the "Pointing Control" window
    and point the telescope to the first position; just be sure the telescope goes to the proper azimuth.  
    Usually the best approach is to have the telescope operator send the telescope to the approx
    AZ, ZA <b> before (tell him/her)</b> he/she starts
    up GALSPECT. <b> <i> If so, don't start CIMA until the telescope is close to position (once you start
    CIMA, the telescope motion will halt until you start the TOGS command file.) </i></b>

</p>

<li><b>Check the TOGS setting</b>: </br>
   The TOGS calibration script contained in <b>command_galfasrc_sep11.cmd</b> now sends the
   telescope to an azimuth and zenith angle and then tracks that position for 5-6 minutes. The
   TOGS team is supposed to keep this file updated.
   All you should need to do is check that the file <b>galfa_togs.cat</b> is set up so that the
   line containing <b>galfasrc</b> has entered a value of the azimuth  (the number entered immediately
   after "galfasrc") close (within 10 degrees of Az)
   to the one planned for A2010. If it doesn't, skip TOGS or edit the file
   yourself to fix it. 
</p>

<li><i><font color="#008000">LET THE OPERATOR DO THIS STEP!</font> 
On the dataview machine do the following to start GALSPECT:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Login to dataview using the a2010 account.  Switch to the 
       guest account via <b>ssh -l guest dataview</b>.  You must do this as guest.</i>
<li><i>In the same xterm window ssh to the galfa1 machines.  <b>ssh -i galfa_key galfa@galfa1</b>.  You should see a '#' prompt. </i>
<li><i> Check if ghost galspect processes are running by typing <b>ps</b>. 
If processes called <b>gdiag</b> are present, kill them by typing the command <b>kill</b> followed by the process number.</i>
<li><i>Warm up GALSPECT via typing <b>/var/diag</b></i>
<li><i>Type the command:  <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  If you get the message 
    LO2:  Set failed, got back:  ERROR setting freq, 
then you need to start the gpib on the wapp server.  
To do this, start CIMA and click <b>Restart GPIB</b> under the
Utilities menu. Go back to the 
xterm logged into galfa1 and again type <b>/var/levels_togs</b>.  You should not receive an error.
</i>
<li><i>Enter the command <b>/var/togs</b>.  This will run for the rest of the night, so minimize the windows</i>.<br>

<font color="#cc0f14"><b>Note: if the operator is not able to get GALSPECT to run, he/she should call the
<a target="_blank" href="http://sites.google.com/site/galfahi/contact-folks">TOGS contact</a> for
the night.</b></font></p></ul>

<li> <b> Log into  OBSERVER2: dtusr </b>  (once the previous observer is out). Password is taped to
computer.</p>

<a target="_blank" name="cima"></a>
<li> <b>Start CIMA on-line GUI </b>when telescope is close to start position. At the moment, you need
    to type <b>cima --X</b> in an available window or right click on the screen background and choose <b>CIMA Online GUI</b>.
   Select the desired version of
    CIMA; this is currently "The 'smart' version of CIMA (3.1.08 2010-02-01 17:44 "Smart")".

   <li>Click <b>Load</b> - to open a menu listing available command files.
   <li>Select the file <b>'command_galfasrc_sep11.cmd' </b> (scroll down) and then <b> click Accept.</b>
   <li>  When the operator has given the OK that TOGS is running, check and, if necesary,
adjust starting the Az, ZA for TOGS in the <b>"galfa_togs.cat"</b> file. Note: The TOGS
team is supposed to update this daily to be close to our Az, ZA; if the file does not have
the same Az, ZA  as we are using, either edit the"galfa_togs.cat" file yourself or skip TOGS.
   <li> Click <b> Run</b> to run the command file. The telescope will slew to requested position and, 
when it reaches the meridian, TOGS calibration will run for ~7 minutes.  <b> Because of the tricks
involved in zenith strip observing, be sure the TOGS command file doesn't move the telescope too much
with respect to the A2010 Az,ZA. If the telescope starts slewing too far or in some whacky
direction (like negative ZA), abort TOGS and go straight to A2010 observing.</b>
   <li>As
soon as "observing menu" appears it can be used to verify settings and
then closed. The "command file" window cannot be closed until the run
file is finished, at which point click <b> Close </b>.
and then continue with <b> Load Configuration</b> menu (below) <br> 
  <li> For for any reason the command file hangs, restart it; make sure that you 
restart from First line by clicking appropriate button at middle left on Command Log GUI.

  <li> <font color="#cc0f14"><i>Note: if the GALSPECT spectrometer is not set up within 
ten minutes of their allotted time (so that

<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> When Observing:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li> As soon as you start observe, run some immediate quick checks. It is especially important that you do this
     in Fall 2011 to be sure that the <b>Az, ZA</b> and <b>ALFA rotation angle</b> are correct.
    <ul>
    <li><b>Check that the telescope is actually at the correct declination </b><br>
           1. Check the declination displayed in the <b>CIMA observation status window</b> &nbsp &nbsp <font color=#cc0f13>Double check during zenith strip observing!</font><br>
           2: Check the "Rslt" line in the <b>monpnt</b> window (the upper right window on the screen
            below the frequency band monitor). Dec value should stay within a few
            arcseconds of the drift value. &nbsp &nbsp <font color=#cc0f13> Double check during zenith strip observing!</font>
    <li><b>Check that the ALFA rotation angle is properly set</b>. Click on <b>telescope</b> in the <b>
           CIMA observation status window</b> and check the number to the right of "ALFA" in the bottom right hand corner
           of the display.&nbsp &nbsp <font color=#cc0f13> Double check during zenith strip observing!</font>
    <li> Check the power levels and waterfall plots as usual.
    </p>
    </ul>
<li>
<a target="_blank" name="log"></a>
<b>Keep a log file </b>- it is very important to keep an accurate log of what happens, even to note "an uneventful night".  To do so:
<ul>
  <li> ssh to another machine as <i>a2010</i>

  <li> open a new file <b>logYYMMDD</b> in <b>/share/obs4/usr/a2010</b>
using you favorite
text editor (vi or pico work well when remote observing; emacs is too
slow, unless you use the '-nw' flag to open in a terminal.) Use a
posted log file as the template. <li> record **anything** of note, especially 
<br>(1) the CIMA version number and the saved state (a2010_az360.gui or a2010_az180.gui) 
    <br>(2) any bad files, 
    <br>(3) any power adjustments, 
    <br> (4) unusual rfi etc. (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> observational troubleshooting list</a> to check 
for notes about specific RFI frequencies.)

<br>To quote Brian: <i> I cannot stress the importance of keeping accurate logs.  
While the file conversion software works automatically, it is good to have a backup to check against when 
comparing scan numbers.  Sometimes CIMA squeezes in extra scans at the beginning or end of the run, or 
has some other unpredictable behavior.  It is also important to note "empty" files, as IDL will hiccup on these.</i>
The folks who calibrate/process the drifts you take will thank you for your carefully note-taking (and will be entirely
justified in saying unkind things about you otherwise).

</ul>
</p>

<li><b>Be vigilant for new sources of RFI; carefully check the waterfall plots and/or quicklook.</b>
Know the expected locations in the band of the "usual suspects". The
FAA radar  is usually at 1350 MHz (although they sometimes use 1330 MHz, out of our bandpass!).
Strong RFI at 1367 and 1382 MHz is due to the
Punta Salinas naval base radar, which should <b>not</b> be on during ALFALFA run 
(see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Erfiuser/smarg-coordPS.html"> this link</a>.) . 
If you see this, ask the operator to 
call Punta Salinas immediately and tell them to turn off their equipment! 
See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naic.edu/%7Ea2010/troubleshooting.html"> 

observational troubleshooting list</a> for other observing issues.)

</li>

</p>
<li><b>Between loops:</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Check power levels periodically. </b>They should stay in the range (0.8,1.2) and be coded 
        <font dark="" blue=""> blue </font> on the dataview observer's monitor. Note any odd power level
         variations in log. (Remote observers: be sure to note in log that you checked periodically.) 
        <b>Do not adjust the power levels during a run unless absolutely necessary; be sure to make a 
           clear note in the log file if you do so; it is necessary to process separately drifts done 
           before and after the adjustment,
           so make sure the processer can tell from the log file how to group the drift files.</b>

    <li>Keep track of the times, file numbers, scan numbers for drift and cal and any notes in the log file. 
    <li>Keep an eye on the declination on the monpnt window on
           the right hand console to make sure it is the same (within
           a few arcsec) of the desired J2000 declination.
    </ul> </p>

<li><b>File Integrity: Check the FITS files to make sure the coordinates are being written correctly.</b>  
     Use the IDL program <b> quicklook. </b> 
     <ul>
       <li> <b> ssh </b> to one of the fast linux machines, like "fusion01", "aolc1", "aolc2" etc.
       <li> &gt cd /share/a2010/idl/eggidl. 
       <li> IDL&gt @wasinit2 
       <li> IDL&gt;  quicklook, '<i>filename</i>'
    <br> where 'filename' is the name of the fits file, with directory path. The directory path can
      be found in the log file, e.g., /share/wappdata/wapp.20061116.a2010.0011.fits
     </ul>
<br>     This is fast and is good to use while remote observing.
         If you want to look at an arbitrary record, see the file "checkfitsnotes.txt" in
         the /share/obs4/usr/a2010 directory.</p>


<li><b><b>Data Monitoring:</b>
    </b><ul>    <li>Use the widgets provided on the dataview computer or within the CIMA widgets (there are
    lots of monitoring tools; learn to use them!). When you
    are in the control room, you can start them from the pull-down menu on
    the dataview machine; be sure that the "CIMA version" is set to what
    you want. Alternatively, you can open the widgets by typing the
    following commands on an xterm: <ul>
      <li><b>alfamonwin</b> &amp; - same display as to the right of the operator's station
      <li><b>alfamotorwin</b> &amp;- shows ALFA rotation angle - good to check at start
      <li><b>alfabeamwin</b> &amp;- shows approximate positions of each beam; 
    can set to RA,Dec (note: currently, the positions aren't quite perfect but still helpful.)
      <li><b>alfaobswin</b> &amp;- smaller window showing the power in dB for each beam
      <li><b>alfadatawin</b>

&amp;- waterfall plots in your color of choice (select ALFA pattern,
then waterfalls from the pull-down menu under diagrams). Too cool.
Enough said. </ul> The latter two (alfadatawin and alfaobswin) are
particularly useful in monitoring the data and should be left up in
plain sight.<br>

    <li>Notice that you will not be able to start <b>alfadatawin</b> if the process is already 
    running on dataview (started by one of the previous observers). If this happens, ask the telescope 
    operator to kill the previous process or, if he cannot, to contact Mikael, Arun, or Phil to do so.
    </ul> </p>

<li><b><b>If there is a power failure...</b>
   There is a remote "reset" switch for ALFA - it is no longer necessary to go up to the dome and push the reset button.

</b>
</ul>

<a target="_blank" name="wapp"></a>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> If the WAPPs get confused...which WILL happen:</font></h2><font color="#cc0f14"> </font>
    The only sign of this happening in CIMA is that messages appear in <font color="red">red</font> in the
    CIMA log window. WAPP error messages include: <font color="red"><i>WAPPs confused</i></font> 
indicates a hardware problem (Note the messages <font color="darkorange"><i>WAPP (3) WARNING - 
Counts don't match for chip 1</i></font> and <font color="darkorange"><i>WAPPDATA-queue_agcdata: 
WARNING received duplicate AGC-datablock</i></font> are not WAPP errors.)
 Occasionally there is no warning message from CIMA, but the countdown
    time on the aostatus window stops, meaning that the WAPPs are no longer taking data.
    Sometimes the problems go away, so try to restart
    the WAPPs and then the observing again.
    <ul>

    <li>Procedure: 
          <ul>
    <li><b>Abort</b> Observation in, e.g.,  the <font color="darkorange">observing menu</font>
        <li><b>Restart the WAPPS </b>under <font color="darkorange"> Utilities </font>
        <li>Repeat start up process
          <ul> <li> <b>Load Configuration</b> as before. <b> Load and Apply </b>
               <li> <b> Reconfigure the WAPPS: </b> Click on B <font
          <font color="darkorange"> Backend Control Menu, </font> which opens the Configure Wapp ALFA
                  window. Check that all WAPPs are using 2 channels
                  and 3 levels and at 100MHz. <b> Accept </b> this configuration.
               <li> In the CIMA observing menu, select drift again and adjust
                    starting time.
               <li> Adjust power and observe.
          </ul>
         </ul>

 If this does not work, try again, up to a few times. If this still does not help,
      exit CIMA and start again.
  If the <font color="red">error messages keep appearing</font>,  it will be necessary to have the operator call an engineer to
    look into the problem. Currently, the WAPP experts are Giacomo Comes and Arun.</p>
   </ul>

<a target="_blank" name="finish"></a>
<h2><font color="#cc0f14"> Finishing Up:</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>After a few seconds of integration time, <b> abort</b> the last unfinished scan.  

<li> <b> If running TOGS: </b> <font color=#cc0f14> Normally in Fall 2011, there is no time scheduled
to run TOGS at the end so skip to next step unless there is a gap before the next program. </font>
<ul> <li> Under <b>Utilities</b>, <b>Restart the WAPPs</b> (note
any error messages when you do this; if you get any, try restarting the WAPPs again)
<li> Go to <b>Command File Observing</b>, and click on <b> Load </b>.  
Choose <b>'command_galfacurpos_sep11.cmd"</b>, click <b> accept </b>,  and 
<b>run</b> the script.  TOGS calibration will take about 6 minutes, so be sure to allow for this before the next program
is set to start. <i>Note: should the telescope run into the ZA limit during TOGS calibration, just let it finish 
(or abort and give up). </i>.</p>

</ul>
<li>Exit CIMA normally
<li>Exit the observer2 machine
<li>Exit data monitoring programs "nicely"
<li>Exit IDL (if you were using it)
<li>CTRL-C out of the GALSPECT control and logout of galfa1 (Let the operator do this!)
<li>Exit out of the dataview machine</p>
