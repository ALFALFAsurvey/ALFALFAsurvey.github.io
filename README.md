# ALFALFAsurvey.github.io
This is the repository containing the ALFALFA survey legacy website. The main site can be accessed at: https://alfalfasurvey.github.io/

The purpose of the website is to:
1) have one landing place for all ALFALFA Legacy information, collecting links from a range of historical ALFALFA websites.
2) create an archive of ALFALFA wisdom.

Note that github limits sites to 1GB, so large files will be held separately on a google drive and linked from this site.

If you have ideas for updating the site, please create an issue/ branch, and then merge in your updates with a pull request when ready.
