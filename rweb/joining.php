<hr align="center" width="700"></center>


ALFALFA is an open collaboration. Anyone with an interest in the science
that can be done with the ALFALFA dataset and the willingness to contribute to
the collective effort is welcome to join. While the ALFALFA team plan to
make the data available to public access on a short time scale
through periodic data releases, direct participation in the collaboration offers
the chance to interact directly with other team members. 
In the spirit of collaboration, members of the team exchange
technical and scientific expertise, gain understanding of the data sets 
in earlier stages of processing, provide training in data processing tasks 
and contribute to setting priorities as the project moves forward.</p>

All <a href="projects/projects.php">science projects</a> by collaboration 
members are posted on the ALFALFA
website, to inform others of who's doing what and on what timescale.
Being a member of the team means sharing in the responsibilities of the
effort. See the recommended guidelines for science projects and authorship.</p>

If you have an idea that could benefit from ALFALFA data and think that
joining the collaboration may be beneficial for its development, contact
Riccardo Giovanelli (riccardo@astro.cornell.edu, 607-255-6505).</p>
