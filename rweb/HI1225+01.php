A truly "dark galaxy'" is an isolated halo consisting only of dark matter.
In some scenarios, it is possible that some optically dark objects
may contain enough HI that a blind HI survey would detect
them. A good example of a "dark" object is the southwestern component
of the binary system known as HI1225+01, discovered serendipitously
at Arecibo by Giovanelli & Haynes in 1989. 
While the northeastern HI component 
hosts a small, star forming dwarf, the SW component has no 
detectable stellar counterpart. VLA observations reveal a velocity
field implying rotation with a peak rotational velocity of 14 km/s, 
yielding a dynamical mass of 10<sup>9</sup> solar masses
and thus a dynamical mass-to-light ratio of 200 
(Chengalur, Giovanelli & Haynes 1995). However, it is not
an isolated object, being part of an apparent binary system.</p>

Matsuoka et al. (2012)</a> still find no associated starlight with HI1225+01b.</p>
