A candidate isolated massive dark galaxy VirgoHI21, was detected by
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.349..922D">Davies <i> et al</i> (2004)</a> 
during the HI Jodrell All-Sky Survey (HIJASS) and
corroborated by Arecibo and WSRT observations 
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1586">Minchin <i>et al</i> 2007</a> ).
VirgoHI21 lies some 100 kpc north of NGC 4254, M99, one of the brightest spiral
galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. Well-known for its prominent optical lopsidedness
and strong m=1 spiral mode, NGC 4254 is about 3 degrees, or 1 Mpc at
the Virgo distance, from M87 and appears to be moving at very
high speed relative to the cluster. Previous observations have suggested that
the galaxy is falling into the cluster for the first time.
It is, however, not HI deficient. As illustrated in the Figure
to the right, the more sensitive ALFALFA observations of the entire field
show clearly the existence of a huge HI stream emanating from NGC 4254;
VirgoHI21 is only one condensation (see below) in this stream. The amount of HI 
detected in the tail by ALFALFA is only about
10% of the total HI gas associated with NGC 4254.
See <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...665L..19H">
Haynes, Giovanelli & Kent (2007)</a> for further details.
</p>

The figure to the right shows contours of HI column density obtained from the
ALFALFA observations of the field around VirgoHI21 and NGC 4254 superposed 
on an optical image. The HI tail extends from NGC 4254 (visible in the lower left) 
     more than 250 kpc to the north (assuming it lies at the Virgo distance of 16.7 Mpc).

 The figure below illustrates the relationship of the feature identified
as VirgoHI21. From left to right, the figure shows the much poorer 
sensitivity of the map made
by Minchin and collaborators with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT), a blow-up of their map in the region of VirgoHI21,
and its position within the much wider area and more sensitive
ALFALFA map made at Arecibo (shown in color
in the figure above). The rightmost panel traces the
velocity of the peak of the HI emission and its velocity
spread along the HI stream
as detected in a set of follow-up observations made
at Arecibo with the single-pixel L-band wide receiver.
It is clear that the WSRT map detected the peaks of the HI
but it did not have adequate sensitivity to be able to trace
the entire structure. Hence, Minchin <i>et al</i>
did not detect much of the gas in between the condensation
they identify as VirgoHI21 and NGC 4254, nor could they trace
its continuation towards the north, clearly evident in the
Arecibo observations. The more sensitive Arecibo map also reveals
that the velocity gradient seen in the vicinity of VirgoHI21, which
Minchin and collaborators interpreted as evidence of rotation, is
part of a much large scale velocity field. 
Note that the ALFALFA map shown here does not cover the velocity
range which detects the redshifted HI from NGC 4262 or the object 
labeled "C" in the middle panel.

In a recent paper, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3991">
Duc & Bournaud </a> (2007) have modeled the formation of a tidal
tail closely resembling that seen in the figures above
by a very high speed encounter of NGC 4254 with another cluster
member now located several degrees away. </p>

The wide areal coverage and superior sensitivity of the Arecibo
telescope and the high data quality achieved by its "minimum
intrusion" observing strategy 
make ALFALFA ideal for detecting extended features at
the Virgo distance. Indeed, ALFALFA has discovered a number of
other optically-dark HI clouds in the periphery of Virgo which may
be of similar origin. That effort is led by 
Cornell graduate student <a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~bkent/">
Brian Kent</a>.</p>

Perhaps a better example of a "dark" galaxy is <a href="HI1225+01.php">
the southwest component of HI1225+01</a> discovered
serendipitously at Arecibo by Riccardo Giovanelli and Martha Haynes in 1989.</p>
